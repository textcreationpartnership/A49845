            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS UPON Mr. <hi>WADSWORTH</hi>'s BOOK OF The <hi>Souls Immortality,</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Opinion of the <hi>Souls Inactivity</hi> to the Time of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſurrection. 80.</head>
            <head type="sub">Printed <hi>London</hi> 1670.</head>
            <p>IN his Epiſtle to the Reader, <hi>Page</hi> 2. he ſays, <hi>There are certain ſober Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, who, tho they deny the Exiſtence of the Soul ſeparate from the Body, yet they maintain the Reſurrection of the whole Man at the Laſt Day, to receive Recompences accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their deſervings in this life:</hi> and thereupon asks the Queſtion, <hi>Is not that ſufficient to uphold Religion and a due Reverence of God in the World?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to which Queſtion, he ſays, <hi>There are ſome Profeſſors among us who deny the Reſurrection of the Body, as ſome of the Quakers are ſaid to do; but yet believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of the Spirit to God who gave it: and then concludes,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107192:2"/>That between one of theſe Opinions and the other, all Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences future to this life, may come to be diſcredited and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which his manner of arguing, I obſerve, That he ſeems to ſet up, if not invent, the Opinion of Denying the Reſurrection of the Perſon, and yet believing that Humane Spirits return to God who gave them. Concerning which Opinion, I ſay, I never heard of the like before, which makes me think it may be an Invention; and the rather, becauſe he gives no better Confirmation of the Truth of it, then that ſome of the Quakers are ſaid to hold it; whereas I rather apprehend the truth to be, that neither the Quakers, nor any other Chriſtians, ever did, or do, deny the Reſurrection of the Dead: and further, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that no reaſonable man, who reads and believes the Scriptures, can deny, or very much doubt, the truth of that Prime Article of our Faith, <hi>The Reſurrection of the Dead:</hi> and further I conceive, That if the Souls Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had any thing near a like clear proof in Scripture, that we find in it for the Reſurrection of the Dead, both I and all other Doubters of ſuch Immortality, would be ready to aſſent and ſubmit to that Opinion; whence I apprehend he pretends to ſet up that which he calls the Quaking Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, on purpoſe to diſcredit and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ery the Practice of mens ſetting up their reſt and expectation, upon the clear and undeniable Article of the Reſurrection of the Dead. But that Article is too well founded and too clearly eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Scripture, to be ſhaken or brought in queſtion by any Inventions of Men whatſoever. <hi>Page</hi> 4. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>Having ſometimes found my own mind hopled and troubleſomely intangled, with the perplexity of conceiving how my Soul could poſſibly exist in a ſeparate ſtate from my Body, to which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo ſtrictly united; and with which I found it by experience ſo much ſo ſympathize in this its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Thus he con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> himſelf to have doubted of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107192:2"/>Soul's Separate Subſiſtence; adding, <hi>That he believed divers others might be troubled with the like doubtings;</hi> and his intent in writing this Book, was to propound to them ſuch Arguments as had ſatisfied the doubts of his own mind. Hereupon I obſerve, That this Author was by Profeſſion a Miniſter of the Goſpel, as appears by the Title Page of his Book; that he was a man of great Reading, Wit, and Induſtry, as plainly appears in the tenour and courſe of his Writing; that he was a true and ſincere Profeſſor of the Chriſtian Religion, and knew very well (as in ſome places of this Book he teſtifies) that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians and later Churches, both Romiſh and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Mahometane Churches, the Heathen Prieſts, Poets, and Philoſophers, and a great number of the Jews and Proſelytes of that Church, have profeſſed with a great Unanimity and Univerſality, to hold and believe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subſiſtence of the Humane Soul in a State of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Body; and yet the Natural Evidences of the ſtrict Union betwixt the Soul and Body, and the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aſſiſtance which the one of them gives to the other, for the production of Life and Action in the Perſon, appear'd ſo ſtrong to the Rational Mind or Faculty of this Writer, as they had power to make him doubt of the poſſibility, or at leaſt the probability, of the Souls Natural Subſiſtence in a State of Separation from the Body: and hence I am apt to infer, that if a Man framed <hi>de meliori luto,</hi> ſo munited and aſſiſted, as this Writer was, did fall into doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Natural Subſiſtence of the Humane Soul in a ſtate of Separation from the Body, it ſeems nothing ſtrange or wonderful, that other perſons leſs fortified, ſhould fall into the like doubts and ſcruples that he did, without falling from the ſincere Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perhaps they may recover from thoſe doubts and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours wherein they are now involved; and next, becauſe ſuch Errour as may be in this Opinion, ſeems meerly Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107192:3"/>and to have little or no influence upon the Lives and Practices of Men; however ſome may put a higher va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thereupon, then perhaps the thing it ſelf may deſerve, for that it commonly ſeems to affect more the terror of the dying, than the reſtraining evil perſons from ſinning: and even at mens deaths it ſeems to lay more terrour upon the weak and fearful, than upon the moſt ſinful and wicked perſons: and in the practices of men it ſeems provable and granted by all parties, that what will make a happy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, will likewiſe make a happy Reſurrection; and what will make the one miſerable, will make the other ſo too, becauſe the Tree lies as it falls, and as Death leaves us, ſo ſhall Judgment find us: and therefore I conclude, that if men do happen to fall under ſuch ſcruples, and do even doubt the Natural Subſiſtence of the Humane Soul in a ſtate of Separation from the Body, and for obtaining bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfaction thereupon, do declare ſuch doubts and, ſcruples to the world, with the reaſons and grounds upon which the ſame is founded, they may not for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, really deſerve to be black'nd with the Names and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Epicure, Sadducee, Deiſt; Atheiſt, and other odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Epithets, which men of eager Spirits do frequently uſe to beſtow upon others who differ from them, in any ſort of Opinions which may be controverted amongſt them, and ſeems to be a practice very much oppoſing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the Doctrines of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 5. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith, <hi>His Mind in this Treatiſe, is to confirm the faith of thoſe who believe the Souls Immortality, or to raiſe up thoſe that are fallen into the doubts and ſcruples before mentioned; of which ſort he was informed there are not a few among the otherwiſe ſerious Profeſſors of Chriſtianity in</hi> England; <hi>who notwithſtanding ſuch ſcruples, might paſs with our Author, for good Chriſtians:</hi> who are to ſtand and fall by their Maſters Judgment, in ſuch Caſes, without being ſubjected, or ſubjecting themſelves to the ſharp Cenſures
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107192:3"/>of other violent or uncharitable perſons. He ſays, <hi>Beſides ſuch doubters, there are other men in</hi> England, <hi>who do not only with you deny the poſſibility of the Souls Seperate ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but do alſo deny, the being of any ſort of Spirits whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> I deſire to rectifie one of his Expreſſions in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, in the ſaying, <hi>There are other men who with you deny the poſſibility of the Souls Seperate ſubſiſtence;</hi> which I would have thus read, <hi>There are other men, who with you deny the probability of the Souls Seperate ſubſiſtence:</hi> and if this alteration happen to be refus'd me, I will alſo refuſe to be comprehended under the words, <hi>with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 7. He ſays, <hi>Men cannot be certain that Souls do not ſubſiſt in a ſtate of ſeparation after Death, or that they are not in a ſtate of happineſs or miſery, till the Reſurrection.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That if ſuch things were once made certain and clear to us, we ſhould need to remain no longer in a doubting condition, as we now do; and therefore we do heartily wiſh and deſire, that God would pleaſe ſo far to inlighten ſome man or men, with a certain or clear knowledge of the truth in this point, as that they may be able to clear the ſame to the underſtanding and minds of ſuch perſons as are very deſirous to be farther and fully inſtructed in this great Point, and divers other particulars thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 5. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſeems to expect <hi>rather thanks than blame, for endeavouring to clear up to mens minds the truth in this Queſtion;</hi> and in this I am fully agreed with him, and am ready to give to him or any other man, who proceeds can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly and fairly (as he doth) my ſincere and hearty thanks, for ſuch labour of love, with intent to draw others from the evil of their ways of Errour of in Practices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 6. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>I conceive ſome who embrace the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Souls Materiality, may be otherways good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and are by this Opinion the most enemies to themſelves; and therefore he deſerves their thanks for endeavouring to draw,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107192:4"/>them out of it.</hi> And I commend his Charitable Profeſſion and Practice, wherein he exceeds divers other maintainers of the Souls Immortality, and give him my iterated thanks for endeavouring to draw me and others out of thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions or Opinions, which he thinks at the beſt, to be our miſtakes and errours: and thus I part with his Epiſtle to the Reader, to make ſome ſuch farther Obſervations upon his following Treatiſe, as to my own underſtanding ſhall appear fit and reaſonable to be done.</p>
            <p>HIS Treatiſe ſtands divided by himſelf into ſeveral Chapters, to each of which I purpoſe to apply the Obſervations intended to be made towards the diſcovery and clearing of the Truths therein deliver'd, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of ſuch Objections or Inferences as he may have drawn from them or built upon them, without true or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grounds for his ſo doing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>PAge</hi> 1. he pretends here to ſpeak of the Soul, as if the Point in diſpute were already granted him, or were judicially determin'd to be on his ſide; for he ſays, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul, <hi>that when ſhe is born down with melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damps of her muddy tabernacle, ſo as to think that at death ſhe ſhall be turned into ſenſleſs ſtupid duſt, ſhe ſtrait grows ſad and affrighted; and then upon the conſideration of her own Immortality, ſhe clears up her doubts, and receives great comfort upon the Opinion which ſhe hath of her being ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.</hi> Hereupon I obſerve, he ſeems to take for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Soul hath thoughts or conceptions of her own, by reflection upon her ſelf or otherways, without being therein aſſiſted by the bodily Organs of that perſon wherein ſhe reſides: now whether ſhe hath ſuch thoughts of her own or not, himſelf very well knows to be one
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107192:4"/>of the main Points in our Controverſie: for that all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialiſts do maintain, ſhe hath no thoughts, activity, or being, but in the Body; and therefore can do nothing without it. I have formerly quoted <hi>Ariſtotle de Anima,</hi> where he calls it a very Improper way of Speaking, for men to ſay, <hi>The Soul is ſorrowful or learned, or wiſe,</hi> and that they might as well ſay, <hi>the ſoul weaves or builds;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all theſe and the like Qualities are not Powers of the Soul, but of the Man, and therefore our Author ſhould have ſaid, when the man is born down by the ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of Death or any other accident, he may take comfort from the high Conceptions of his Immortality; but in the mean time, it ſeems Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſtumbles dangerouſly at the very Threſhold or Entrance of this Diſpute, and muſt either have that granted him which he knows his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents do utterly deny; or otherways all that he ſays in this Paragraph muſt paſs for a <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> without ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any purpoſe in the Diſpute of that Queſtion which he at this time pretends to handle.</p>
               <p>P. 2. He goes on and ſays, <hi>He cannot believe his Souls confidence of her own Immortality, to be a diſtempered fit of her ſpirit, prone to believe that to be, which ſhe deſires may be, becauſe he finds men of the beſt tempers and practices to be of that Opinion:</hi> as if this Opinion of the Souls Immortality, were a plant that co0uld ſpring and thrive only in a pure Conſcience and a Mind united to God. He ſays, <hi>This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Souls Immortality is ſo appropriate to the wiſeſt and beſt of men, as it ſeems an abſurd ſuggeſtion, that it ſhould have riſen from mens own Imaginations:</hi> but it ſeems rather evident, that the Souls of men having in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure recovered their priſtine holineſs and integrity, they thence begin to know themſelves and their <hi>alliance to the great God, and ſee plainly, that they do not only bear his Image in righteouſneſs and holineſs, but likewiſe in Immortality.</hi> Upon this Paragraph I obſerve that no man charges the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107192:5"/>Opinion of the Souls Immortality, that it is a bare Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mens idle brains or phantaſies, but we are ready to grant that this Opinion is founded upon antient and great Authority, and was firſt introduced into the Heathen World, by the Doctrine of <hi>Phericides Syrus,</hi> whoſe Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> built upon that Conception his Opinion of the Tranſmigration of Souls from one Creature to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a general Community both to Men and Beaſts; which Opinion was generally received by the World of his time, and was thence propagated to future Generations, and continues at this day to be firmly believed in the Eaſtern Parts of the World, of <hi>India, China,</hi> and <hi>Japan. Plato</hi> became a Scholar to the Succeſſors of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in that Doctrine and Opinion, which by his <hi>Genius</hi> became ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refined, by rejecting a Community of Souls, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed to be betwixt Men and Beaſts; and confining the Tranſmigration of Humane Souls to the Bodies of Men only; conceiving withal that ſome more perfect and pure Souls amongſt them, might ſo have acted in Bodies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lived, as they might deſerve to be delivered from the Drudgery of acting Humane Bodies any longer: and therefore were received up into higher Regions and Places, where they enjoyed ſuch Happineſs and Powers of Acting, as far exceeded the moſt Happy State upon Earth. This Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> found great Credit amongſt the Learned Perſons which came after him, and particularly in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Chriſtian Schools of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> as appears by the Writings of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Pantenus,</hi> who were Chriſtian Doctors, and Teachers in thoſe Schools at <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and this Opinion ſeems to have been alſo ſpread amongſt the Nation of the Jews and Proſelytes of their Churches; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that when St. <hi>Matthew</hi> comes to relate our Lords Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Direction rather to fear God than Men, for that God can puniſh men after Death, which is not in the power of men to do; he words it thus, <hi>Fear not men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107192:5"/>they can only kill the body, but cannot kill the ſoul:</hi> Which plainly proves it to be that Apoſtles Opinion, That the Soul might have, and had a natural Subſiſtence in a State of Seperation from the Body; and that his believing the Truth of this Doctrine, was the Cauſe why he worded our Lord's Direction in this Point, as we find him to have done in the Text before quoted. By what hath been ſaid before, it appears clearly, we do not charge the Opinion of the Souls Immortality with being the Product of Mens idle Brains or Fancies, grounded upon their own Deſires, of having it paſs'd for an eſtabliſh'd Truth; for we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and agree'd, That the ſame is grounded, in a learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and very great Authority, whence it hath grown to be the moſt general, and near the univerſal Opinion of Mankind; which having been ſo entertain'd, Mothers and Nurſes have inſtill'd the ſame into the Minds and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their tender Infants, who by Fathers and Maſters, are after farther confirmed, in this ſo early radicated Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is after farther illuſtrated, and prov'd to them, from Pulpits, and the Miniſters of their Churches: And this Deduction manifeſts, That we do not Charge the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Immortality, with being the Product of Mens idle Brains or Fancies; or their Deſires concerning the Truth of it. As to what he pretends, That the Immortal Opinion thrives only, or moſtly, amongſt the wiſeſt, and beſt Practicers of the Chriſtian Profeſſion. I conceive him therein to be miſtaken, and think, that for every wiſe and good Man which he can produce, proſalted to believe and maintain the Opinion of the Immortality, I ſhall be always able to produce twenty Senſualiſts at leaſt, and evil Livers, who will be ready with great Zeal and Conſtancy, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion of the Immortality to the uttermoſt. As to his ſaying, <hi>That Men attain to the Image of God in Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, and Immortality.</hi> I find in my ſelf no inclination to grant him, That any Men,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107192:6"/>whil'ſt in this World, do attain to the Image of God in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Particulars. I find it written. That <hi>God made man after his own Image, and in the Image of God, made he man.</hi> But I do not find my ſelf able to explicate, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the true and full Scope and Meaning of theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, nor wherein the Image of God in man doth conſiſt; but am very apt to think, That man was not made like God in Immortality; becauſe then there would have been no need of the Fruit of the Tree of Life, to make Men live for ever. But we read, That God made that Tree and Fruit grow out of the Earth, to that very purpoſe, that Man by eating of that Fruit, might become Immortal, and live for ever; and that upon his Sin he was debarr'd from eating of that Fruit, and loſt that Remedy, which God had provided againſt the ſtroke of Death; and in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hath his Poſterity remain'd ever ſince his Commiſſion of that Sin againſt God: And therefore I think St. <hi>John</hi> informs us truly, when he ſays, <hi>We know not yet what we ſhall be, but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him:</hi> And therefore I leave the Pretences to ſuch Knowledge; to the Time of our Lord's ſecond Appearance, and ſitting upon the Throne of his Glory, when Men of good Practices may hope to be like him; and that I think is ſufficient to ſatisfie the reaſonable and moſt exalted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 3. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays; <hi>Whilſt the Spirit of Man continues its Conflicts with the Fleſh, and the Luſts thereof, (as ſhe will whilſt ſhe abides in the Body) it is needful to maintain in her the Thoughts of her Immortality.</hi> Here I obſerve, that when he ſpeaks of the Spirits conteſting with the Fleſh, he ſays, <hi>It continues that Conflict with the Fleſh, and the Luſts thereof, as it will whilſt ſhe abides in the Body, and therefore it is needful to maintain in her, high Thoughts of her ſelf.</hi> By this manner of Speaking, he firſt expreſſes, that Spirit by the Name of it, and preſently, without giving any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107192:6"/>Reaſon, ſlides down upon it the Title of She and Her, as if the daily Conteſts betwixt the Fleſh and Spirit of Man intended a Contention between his Body, and an Immortal intelligent Spirit within it; expreſſing that Spirit, by Terms of She and Her. But I differ from him therein, conceiving that by the Fleſh and Spirits ſo contending one againſt the other, is chiefly, and even only intended, the Conteſts which are daily found between Mens Affections, and other Senſual Powers, and the Minds, or Rational Faculties of the ſame Perſon; and his ſliding the Terms of She and Her into this Diſcourſe, with deſign to have it thought, that theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts are maintained by an intelligent immortal Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Body wherein ſhe lives, looks to my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, like a ſort of Legerdemain, which may perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon very unwary Readers, but will not be ſuffer'd ſo to paſs, by conſiderate Examiners of his Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 4. He ſays, <hi>That She, his Immortal Spirit, will continue her Conflict with the Body ſo long as ſhe is in it.</hi> I am ready to Agree, That ſuch a Conteſt between the Senſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Rational Faculties of Men, is likely to continue throughout, and during the whole Life of the Perſon, but that this ſort of Conteſt is ſo maintain'd between the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Intelligent Soul, and the Body of that Perſon whom ſhe enlivens, I am very apt and ready to deny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 4. He ſays further, <hi>If we ſeek Encouragement againſt the Fear of Death, there is no Truth can arm us with a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, than the Belief of the Souls Immortality.</hi> And I grant, that if this were a Truth, ſufficiently evidenced to the Underſtandings and Conſciences of Men, it would be a great ſtrengthening to ſuch Perſons as have a very good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their own Merits, to make their Paſſage through the Gates of Death, with great Boldneſs and Aſſurance; but to thoſe who are working out their own Salvation with fear and trembling, and are very humble in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of their own Merits; who tremble more at the ſight
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107192:7"/>of their Sins, than they are confident in the Merit of their Actions (who I think make the greater Number of People in the World;) his Opinion of the Souls Immortality, and the immediate paſſing from Death to Judgement, and fiery Condemnation of ill deſerving People, gives Terror and Affrightment, rather than Comfort and Support to, by far the greateſt part of People in the World; and if the Tenet be not true, and cannot be ſufficiently proved to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and Conſciences of Men, it may then paſs for a Scare-Crow to the Bad, and a Staff of Reed to ſuch good People as may put their Confidence in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> further demands, <hi>Can any hearty Lover of the Lord Jeſus, think of the Interruption of his Communion with him, from Death to Judgment, without great Regret and Trouble of Mind?</hi> And he ſays, <hi>He is ſure the Generation of the Righteous think it much otherwiſe.</hi> To this I Anſwer, <hi>That the Generation of the Righteous, may think, ſome one thing, and ſome another; and thereupon I conceive, that divers of them will be very well contented with ſuch a Portion of Happineſs, as the Spirit in the Revelation tells us they ſhall enjoy, in the Words; Yea, ſaith the Spirit, they reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them; and at the end of that, Reſt ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, and be joined again to them, at the end and time of their intended Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 5. He further demands, <hi>Is this enough to quiet the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Longings of the Divine Nature in us after Immortality, and to ſatisfie our lively Hope of an Eternal Life with God and the Lamb? Away,</hi> ſays he, <hi>This is but to trifle with the greateſt Concernments of the Lords People.</hi> To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. This ſeems but a Rhetorical Flouriſh, without any true Subſtance in the matter of it. It ſeems a kind of Cant, which I do not well underſtand, when he ſpeaks of, <hi>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervent Longings of the Divine Nature in us after Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi> This may perhaps ſeem plain to Men of his Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Conſtitution; but to me it looks like a <hi>Riddle me, what is this?</hi> For I know of no Divine Nature in one man,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107192:7"/>more than in another; and I do not conceive it natural for Men to be troubled with ſuch Longings after Immortality, as he pretends here to deſcribe. I think Men do ſometimes long for things which they do deſire, and have a likely and very ſtrong Hope to obtain; but thoſe who entertain no Hopes of an Intermediate State betwixt Death and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, muſt be very weak in their Rationals, if they trouble themſelves with any Longings after ſuch a State, or receive any Diſappointment upon their going without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 6. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> enters into ſomewhat a long Diſcourſe, wherein he largely Cenſures and Condemns ſuch, as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Souls Extinguiſhment at the Diſſolution of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Perſon. I will ſpend no Time in giving particular Anſwers thereunto, but content my ſelf with only ſaying thereupon, that it all wants Proof, and paſſes with me for a <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> which hath no ſtrength of Argument in it, concerning that Queſtion, about which we now differ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 7. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes that Prophecy, which gives, <hi>A Woe to thoſe who make the Hearts of the Righteous ſad, whom the Lord hath not made ſad;</hi> and Applies thoſe Words to thoſe who oppoſe his Opinion of the Souls Immortality: And thereupon this ſeems to be the Caſe, thoſe who maintain a Point of Doctrine, contrary to Truth, which may make the Righteous ſad, the Woe pronounced by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, pertains to that Maintainer; whence if the Souls Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhment at the Death of the Party be not true, it may probably make the Hearts of ſome Righteous People ſad, whom God hath not made ſad; and then our Prophets Woe may juſtly be impoſed upon ſuch Maintainers: But if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhould ſo fall out, that this Opinion be True; and that of the Souls Immortality, be an Error: Then thoſe whoſe Hearts are made ſad by that Doctrine (which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are by far the greateſt Number of People in the World) are ſo ſadned by an Erroneous Tenet, deliver'd without a ſufficient Warrant from God. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107192:8"/>the Hearts of ſuch People will be made ſad, whom God hath not made ſad: And thereupon I conclude, that if the Doctrine of the Soul's Immortality be not True, the Woe delivered in this Prophecy, will as juſtly take hold of the Maintainers of it, as it will do upon their Oppoſers, if they maintain an Errour, altho' they may think themſelves to have the Right in this Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 7. He pretends that we have, or may have once learn'd to know, that God hath framed us for an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted perpetuity of living. I ſay to this, I am aſſured in my ſelf, and both can, and do aſſure my Reader, that if I did know or believe, what he ſays in this Place to be true, I would readily ſubmit to his Dictator-ſhip in it, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further proceeding in a Diſpute of this Nature: But I do neither know, nor believe, the Truth of what he ſays in this Place, conceiving it ſtill more probable, that the Soul extinguiſheth at the Death of the Perſon, and is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Immortal nor Intelligent, having no other Place of Subſiſtence, but in the Body.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> he ſays, <hi>The Soul is there taken for the whole Perſon of Man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly, Soul is there taken for the Body of Man only.</hi>

                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Soul is taken for the Life of the Body.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Soul is taken for the dead Carcaſs of a Man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fifthly, The Word Soul is taken for the Rational Soul of Man; whereby he ſtands in a kind of Level with Angels.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>By which I ſuppoſe he intends the Humane Soul, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107192:8"/>Life and Action in the Perſon which he ſays is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and labours to prove it ſo; and therefore brings Inſtances out of Scripture, to ſhew the Truth and Practice of theſe Significations. And hereupon I obſerve, That his firſt Acceptation of the Word Soul, for the whole Perſon of Man conſtituted of Soul and Body, is very common throughout the whole Courſe of the Scripture, well proved by the Inſtances which he gives, to which Hundreds more might be added, if any need ſhould ariſe for the ſo doing: But the Inſtances of his Second Signification, ſeem not to prove what he intends by them; for that the Iron entering into <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Soul, ſeems not to be intended only of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but of his Perſon; for that his Body without a Soul, could not be ſenſible; or capable of ſuffering thereby.</p>
               <p>His next Inſtance is, of ſending Leanneſs into the Souls of thoſe that eat the Quails: It ſeems, the Word Soul here, doth alſo intend the whole Perſons of the Eaters; for that Bodies cannot eat, or be nouriſhed without their Souls.</p>
               <p>Concerning his Third Saying, <hi>That Soul is taken for the Life of the Body:</hi> It ſeems, the Inſtances which he brings, do all apply to the Life of the Perſon, and not of the Body only; for all men know that the Body can have no Life without the Soul; and therefore, theſe which he pleaſes to apply to the Body only, ought really to be intended of the whole Humane Perſon.</p>
               <p>The Inſtances which he brings, to prove the 4th. Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Word Soul, to ſignifie ſometimes a Dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs, he offers to prove by theſe Words, <hi>Ye ſhall not make any Cuttings in your Fleſh for the Soul.</hi> Here he pretends the Word Soul, ſignifies nothing but the Dead Carcaſs: But I refuſe to Agree with him in it, conceiving as I do, that the Word Soul here, intends the Dead Perſon; for I do nor believe men to have been ſo ſottiſh, as to have made Cuttings in their Fleſh for the Dead Carcaſſes of their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107192:9"/>Friends, as he ſuppoſes; but that rather they made ſuch Cuttings in their Fleſh, for Grief and Remembrance of their Dead Friends, not for any of their Parts, but for the whole Perſons of them.</p>
               <p>His 5th. Signification of the Word Soul, which he takes to intend ſingly, the Rational Immortal Soul of Man, he proves by Inſtances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law is perfect, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Soul.</hi> He pretends the Word Soul in this Place, ſignifies Man's Immortal Soul, ſingly conſider'd, and without the Body. This I deny, and ſay, this converting of the Soul, inrends converting of the Perſon, or of the whole Man, as he is a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Soul and Body. Again, he Quotes <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Lay up theſe my Words in your Soul;</hi> which I think ſomewhat plainly to ſignifie, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Lay up theſe my words in your hearts, or in your ſelves,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and compounded of Soul, and Body. He Quotes again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Love the Lord with all your Soul:</hi> To which he might have added, <hi>with all your Heart, and all your. Strength:</hi> Which make this Text clearly appear to intend, Love the Lord with all the eminent Faculties of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Then he ſays, There are more Significations of the Word Soul, in Scripture, beſides thoſe Five which he hath named; and which by Examination of his Inſtances, have been found to run all into one, which intends the whole Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Perſon, as it is a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Soul and Body. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (as one of his other Significations) the Words, <hi>Deliver me not up to the Soul of my Enemies:</hi> Which I think intends, To be not deliver'd up to the Perſons or Powers of his Enemies. He ſays again, <hi>The word Soul ſometimes ſignifies ſome one Power of the Senſative Soul, as the Breath of Man or Beaſt; and ſometimes for ſome ſingle Power of the Rational Soul, which I think he ſhould have termed ſome ſingle Power of the Mind, or of the Man:</hi> And therein I am ready to agree with him, that the World Soul in Scripture, doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times ſignifie the vehement Deſires or Affections of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107192:9"/>Perſon; but I do not remember, that the Word Soul is any where uſed in Scripture, to ſignifie the Soul of Man (by our Author intended) except only that Text of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> which ſays, <hi>Men are not able to kill the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 11. He ſays further, he takes the Word Soul, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Man's Intellectual Soul; becauſe in no other ſenſe can the Soul be ſaid to be Immortal: And I deny, that in that ſenſe, it can truly be ſaid to be Immortal. Then he ſays further, <hi>That the Soul which is now plainly alive, while in our Bodies, ſhall never ceaſe to live, or be annihilated.</hi> And this I conceive to be the thing which he undertakes to prove; and when he hath ſo done, in a ſufficient convincing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I do fully intend to be his Proſelite, and to ſubmit my Belief to his Direction in this Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 12. He diſcourſes of the Soul's Annihilation by the Power of God, which, as a thing not now queſtion'd, or controverted, nor very material in this preſent Diſquiſition, I paſs over without farther Obſervation thereupon.</p>

                  <hi>PAge</hi> 13. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>I ſhall now lay down Five Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I conceive have a great Tendency to Clear up this great Truth [Of the Soul's Immortality.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Firſt wherof is this, That the Soul and Body of Man, are not one and the ſame Being, but are Beings really diſtinct: Becauſe,</hi> ſays he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>they were created one after the other, and not at one and the ſame time.</hi> And this he ſays is evident, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2 the Words whereof run thus in our Tranſlation, <hi>The Lord God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul.</hi> He ſays it ſhould have been thus render'd, <hi>God breathed into</hi> Adam<hi>'s noſtrils the breath of life, or ſoul of life, or living ſoul.</hi> But I am more ready to rely upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our Tranſlators, than upon the ſingle Credit of a Perſon engaged in Controverſie, and to whoſe Cauſe this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107192:10"/>ſort of Tranſlation may be helpful. Both of us have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded and agreed, that the Word Soul in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth often intend and ſignifie the Perſon; and ſo I do fully believe, and conclude it doth in this Text, and bears the ſame Senſe, as if it had been ſaid in proper Words, <hi>God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and man became a living perſon.</hi> He ſays, and pretends that theſe Words in <hi>Gen.</hi> are a clear Demonſtration of the Soul's being created by God after the Body finiſhed; that he knows not what to add, to make it more clear: And I am very apt to believe that he ſpeaks Truth in it, and really doth not know what more to add, to make it more clear to the Underſtandings of Men; for if he did, I ſee no cauſe to believe, that he would be ſparing of his Pains to that Purpoſe. I am not able my ſelf to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect out of this Text, that the Soul and Body of <hi>Adam</hi> were created one after the other; no, nor that any Soul at all was created for <hi>Adam,</hi> either before or after the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Body. The Words themſelves of the Text, do not expreſs, that God created a Soul for <hi>Adam,</hi> but ſay, <hi>God breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and by breathing that breath into him, he became a living perſon. Gen.</hi> 1.5. The Text ſays, <hi>God made the beaſt of the earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after their kind, as he had before crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great whales and fiſhes in the water, and fowls to flye in the midst of Heaven.</hi> Our daily Obſervations may aſſure us, the Lives of all theſe are maintained by the ambient Air, and the Breath which from thence they draw, and without which they cannot ſubſiſt or live, for the ſpace of ſome few moments, which hath been often experienced by the Air-Pump, in the caſe of Infects thereinto injected. This Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Breath, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.19. is judged by <hi>Solomon</hi> to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame with the Humane, in theſe Words, <hi>Yea, they have all one breath.</hi> In the flood of <hi>Noah</hi> we read, <hi>That all in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107192:10"/>whoſe noſtrils the breath of life was, died in that flood.</hi> And clear it is, they ſo died, becauſe the Waters ſtopped the paſſage of that Breath, by which they before lived: And if it ſhall be demanded, by what means theſe Creatures ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their firſt Breath, I conceive it was given them by the ſame, or the like Means, that <hi>Adam</hi> afterwards received it. A <hi>Specimen</hi> of which we find recorded, <hi>Ver.</hi> 37. where a vaſt number of dry Bones received a ſudden and powerful Reſurrection: For firſt, <hi>They came together, bone to his bone.</hi> Next to which, <hi>loe, the ſinews, and fleſh came up upon them, and then the skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</hi> Then God commanded that Prophet to propheſie unto the Winds, <hi>and ſay, come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon theſe ſlain, that they may live.</hi> So he propheſied as he was commanded, <hi>and the breath came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and they lived, and ſtood up upon their feet an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Army.</hi> And thus I conceive it fared with <hi>Adam,</hi> at his firſt Creation, the Bones, Ligaments, and principal Parts were framed and fitted, one of them to another, upon which were formed their Fleſh and Sinews, over all which, the Skin was laſtly ſuper-induced: And after this manner it ſeems <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body was firſt created and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, altho he lived not, becauſe there was yet no Breath in him; his blood and Humours were turgid, and full of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, fit and apt to tin'd, and have the Flame of Life kindled in them, with the firſt Blaſt of that Breath, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to breathe into him for that purpoſe: And this Flame of Life he then appointed to be continually maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bodies of Beaſts, and in the Perſons of Men, by breathing and the conſtant fannings of the ambient Air, ſo as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>P.</hi> 14. To prove that the Soul and Body are Two ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſingular, and different Beings, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5.23. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>I pray God, your Spirit, Soul and Body, be preſerved blameleſs.</hi> Himſelf confeſſes, he knows not well how to diſtinguiſh betwixt Soul and Spirit in this Text; but yet he declares himſelf certain, that there is a Diſtinction aſſerted betwixt them, and the Body: And I Reply, That the being of a Diſtinction betwixt them, is no good Proof, that the Soul can ſubſiſt in a State of Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Body; for that the Relatives in the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are really diſtinct one of them from the other, and yet no Diviſion, or Seperation, can poſſibly be admitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: And I farther conceive upon this Text, that by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, of <hi>Soul, Spirit, and Body,</hi> he intended no otherwiſe, than that their whole Perſons, Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And I deſire my Reader to obſerve here, that which I think to be a Failure in our learned and pious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; this Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> truly and fully quoted, runs thus, <hi>The very God of Peace ſanctifie you wholly, and I pray God, your whole Spirit, Soul and Body, be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107192:11"/>thus; <hi>I pray God, your Spirit, and Body, be preſerved blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> &amp;c. By which it appears, that he omits the Word <hi>wholly,</hi> and ſuppreſſes the Word <hi>whole</hi> in the beginning of the Text, and then cuts it ſhort in the end, before he comes to the Words, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and chuſing to ſupply them by an <hi>Et caetera.</hi> It ſeems, this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious way of quoting Scripture, did not fall upon our Author by chance, but had a ſet Purpoſe in them; and that he left out the Words <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>whole,</hi> in the Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may ſeem to Confirm and Fortifie my Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which is, that the Words, <hi>SPIRIT, SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> and <hi>BODY,</hi> do all intend no more but the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Correſpondents: And he cuts off before the Words, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he might avoid producing a very ſtrong evidence againſt the Opinion which he maintains: Becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not pray God to preſerve their Souls or Spirits at the time of their Departure out of this World, but to preſerve their whole Perſons, <hi>Souls and Bodies blameleſs, unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> As if he knew of no time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Puniſhment, after this Life, unto the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. A like Charitable Prayer to this, is delivered by the ſame Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. where he ſays, <hi>The Lord give Mercy to the Houſe of</hi> Oneſyphorus, <hi>and the Lord grant unto him, that he may find Mercy in that day, viz.</hi> The Day, or Time, of our Lords Second Coming. And ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 4 he ſays, <hi>My Departure out of this World is at hand, and henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord Jeſus, the Righteous Judge, ſhall give me at that day; and not to me only, but to them alſo that love his Appearing.</hi> Theſe laſt Words fixt the Time, when ſuch Crowns ſhall be diſtributed, <hi>viz.</hi> The Time of Chriſt's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Appearing to the World. And becauſe the Point thus fall'n under Examination, ſeems one of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which is now in Queſtion between us, I will produce
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107192:12"/>ſome further Evidence, ſtrongly tending to maintain my Part of this Queſtion, and place our Lord himſelf in the Front of my other Witneſſes. He ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.27. <hi>Then ſhall they ſee the Son of Man coming in a Cloud, with Power, and great Glory; and when thoſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your Heads, for your Redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh.</hi> Joh. 14.2. Chriſt ſays, <hi>In my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions; I go to prepare a Place for you: And if I go and prepare a Place for you, I will come again, and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, you may be there alſo.</hi>

               <p>Here the Time, when Chriſt would receive his Choſen to himſelf; and to be where he is, is declared to be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, with his coming to Judgment. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.27. <hi>God the Father hath given Authority to the Son, to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of Man.

In the Four Verſes quoted, and marked out of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, our Lord declares both to his own Diſciples, and to the Jews, <hi>That whoſo doth his Will, and keep his Commandments, he will raiſe them up at the laſt day,</hi> [and give them Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and great Rewards] without mention of an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate State, between Death and that Reſurrection. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.13, 14. Our Lord himſelf directs, <hi>When thou makeſt a Feaſt, call the Poor, the Maimed, the Lame, and the Blind, and thou ſhalt be bleſſed, for they cannot recompence thee; for thou ſhalt be recompenced at the Reſurrection of the Just.</hi> And ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. After a large Catalogue of the Saints Sufferings, the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>That they would not accept of Deliverance, becauſe they expected a better Reſurrection.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. ſays, <hi>If after the manner of Men I have fought with Beaſts at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>What advantageth it me, if the dead riſe not? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die,</hi> [And there is an end of us.] As if he had ſaid, the Sufferings of Chriſtians for the Name of Chriſt, ſhall avail them nothing, if there be not a Reſurrection of the Dead; and I demand ſome one Text of Scripture to be produced, which expreſſes, or with any Clearneſs, ſays, That any Man, or Men, ever did, or ſuffer'd any thing, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or with Expectation of having their Soul or Souls carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſome, after the Death of their Perſons. To our Fore-quoted Texts, may be added the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13. <hi>Rejoice, inaſmuch as ye are made Partakers of Christ</hi>'s <hi>Sufferings, that when his Glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding great Joy.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.1. he ſays, <hi>I who am alſo a Partaker of the Glory which ſhall be revealed, exhort you that are Elders of the Church, to do the Duties faithfully; and when the Chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a Crown of Glory, which ſadeth not away.</hi> He doth not ſay, Have Patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>Jude</hi> 17. Says, <hi>The Lord cometh with Ten Thouſand of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly amongst Men.</hi> And thus I have quoted a great Cloud of very knowing Witneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> our Lord Himſelf, and all his writing Apoſtles which are come to our Hands, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Proof of this Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Faithful dy'd, and ſuffered many great things, in aſſured Hope and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of great Rewards to be given, and Puniſhments to be inflicted, at the Time of our Lord's ſecond Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of the Reſurrection, and of the Laſt Judgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding any foot-ſteps of the Souls Immortality, it's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Subſiſtence from the Body, or any Rewards or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to be beſtowed upon it, in the ſpace of time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate between Death and our Lord's Second Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I now return to a further Conſideration of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Quotations, who <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. goes on, and quotes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Ye are bought with a Price, therefore glorifie God in your Body, and in your Spirit, which are God</hi>'s. Which I think intends no more, than if it had been ſaid, Glorifie God in your ſelves, or in your whole Perſons, which are God's. Then he quotes <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Men that can kill the Body, are not able to kill the Soul.</hi> We ſhall hear this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection more fully offered in another Place, and thither I refer my Reader for an Anſwer to it. He next quotes 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.1. where the Words are, <hi>Dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the Fleſh, and of the Spirit.</hi> Here, by the Terms Fleſh and Spirit, the Apoſtle

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ctions and Appetites, by the Term Fleſh, and the Rational Mind or Faculty of Man, by the Term Spirit: And this Tropical ſort, or manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf, I conceive to be very much uſed in this Apoſtles Writings. Next he quotes <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. which ſays, <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other.</hi> This I think to be another of this Apoſtles Expreſſions, to be taken in the ſame intent and meaning with the former, as a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Texts before quoted. He ſays he could quote more Texts, to prove that wide Difference, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be between the Soul and Body. I ſay to this, that if he knew of more Texts very pertinent to this Purpoſe, I think he ought not to have ſpared his Pains in the Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: But ſaith he, <hi>The Texts which I have already quoted, are abundantly ſufficient for the Proof of my firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</hi> Which firſt Propoſition I think to have been, <hi>That the Soul was of a quite different nature from the Body,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Soul was an Immortal Intelligent Spirit, which can ſubſiſt by it ſelf, and in a ſtate of ſeperation from the Body, and the Body it ſelf, but a Compoſitum of Duſt and Aſhes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it ſhall be again reſolved, ſoon after the Death of the Perſon.</hi> The Later Part of this Propoſition, he neither hath offered to Prove, nor needed to do it, becauſe it is a Truth granted on both ſides; but his labour hath been to prove, <hi>That the Soul is a ſeperable intelligent Spirit, and of a quite different Nature from the Body.</hi> But I think he hath here given very little Proof to that Purpoſe, ſo far from being abundantly ſufficient, as that I think it ſcarce touches upon the Verges of his intended Propoſition; but how ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath thereof acquitted himſelf, I do freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly leave to the Judgment of ſuch Perſons, as may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to peruſe our Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 15. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> delivers his ſecond Propoſition, which he ſays is this, <hi>That the Soul and Body are not only Two in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107192:14"/>but that they are two Beings of a very different Nature.</hi> His ſecond Propoſition ſeems to be ſo near of kin to his firſt, that the Difference between them is not very evident; and the Proof which he gives of this ſecond Propoſition, ſeems to be coincident, with the Proofs which he gave of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for he ſays here, <hi>That the Soul was immediately crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God.</hi> Which Suppoſal he had before laid down as a Proof of his firſt Propoſition; and I have given it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch an Anſwer, as ſatisfies my own Underſtanding: And therefore I ſhall need to ſay no more of it here, but that it paſſes with me for an unſound and fallacious Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; whence I think fit to reject, without further Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, all the Inferences and Arguments, which he may pretend to draw from ſo unweak and unſound a Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He quotes for a Proof of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examined, and in this place I ſhall ſay no more of it. He ſays further, <hi>The Body and all its Parts, are but lifeleſs, ſenſeleſs things, in themſelves:</hi> And herein I grant he ſays true; and ſo are the Three Elements of Fire, Air, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet the two former are of ſo Active a Nature, that they are always in Motion, like thoſe Particles which we call Motes in the Sun; and therefore may juſtly have the Reputation of ſelf-moving Principles: And Water hath a propenſity to Motion, ſo natural, that give it but a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and it can have no reſt till it come to a place ſo even, as it may ſtand in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> free from the Impulſe of any declination whatſoever. It ſeems then, that upon rinding and kindling the pullulent ſteams of Old <hi>Adam</hi>'s Blood and Humours (ready for that purpoſe) that Breath which God then breathed into his Noſtrils, became the Breath of Life to him, by kindling the Flame of Life, in thoſe Steams of his Blood and Humours, which God had made ready for that Operation; and this Flame, or glowing of the Blood, was immediately catch'd and diſperſs'd into the Vital, and all other Parts of the Body, putting them all in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107192:14"/>Motion and Attendency, to perform all thoſe Operations, for which God had made them, and we may conceive, were intended to be produced in the Perſon then Created, and in all other Perſons which ſhould after be Generated by Him: Whence it ſeems, that what is called the Breath of Life to <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſame Breath, or ambient Air, became the Breath of Life to all Poſterity: For by this <hi>Medium,</hi> ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by the Lungs, the Flame of Life firſt kindled in the Body, is fann'd, and kept glowing in the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours thereof. And thus the Flame of Life muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fann'd, maintain'd, and purified by the Breath; and by the Vigor and Activity of this Inflammation, the Blood and Humours are kept in perpetual Motion, and in a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and endleſs Circulation, ſo long as the Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are able to endure the Activity of ſuch Motion; and until by Age, or Decay of ſome of the Bodily Parts, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or Stagnation of the Blood; or by ſome Accident, this Flame of Life happen to be totally extinguiſh'd throughout every Part and Member of the Body; and ſuch total Extinguiſhment of the Vital Flame, I eſteem to be the Death of the Perſon.

               <p>And from theſe Grounds I Argue, That tho the Blood and Humours be but Matter, and unintelligent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elves, as well as the Fleſh, Bones, and other groſs Parts of he Body, yet God's great Wiſdom hath ſo framed the Microcoſm, or Perſon, and ſo organiz'd the Bodies of them, as that every Part is fitted and ready for thoſe Acts, for which they were intended; and theſe Organs rightly moved and acted, by the Spirits inflamed, and Humours of the Body, do in a right Mixture one with another, and by the working of ſuch Spirits among and upon the Organs, produce or effect thelocal Motions, Senſes, and ſuch Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence as pertain to Men and Beaſts, and are produced, acted, and performed, in the ſeveral Species of them, ſo long as thoſe Spirits and Humours are maintained in the Body, by a due Refection and Nouriſhment; and ſo long as this Vital Flame continues to be fanned by the due Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations both of Man and Beaſt. And this I give for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſecond Proof of his ſecond Propoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vaſt Diverſity, as he calls it, of the Nature of the Soul from that of the Body.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> goes on to a Third Proof of this Diverſity, and ſaith, <hi>The Body is often tired, and ſpent, and indiſpoſed to Action, when at the ſame time the Soul hath a Will, and is bent to Action.</hi> Which I thus Paraphraſe, The Man, his Mind, Affections, or Will, may be ſtrongly bent to Action, when his Bodily Members may be very weary, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſpent: And thus expreſs'd, I grant, and know that what he ſays may be true, <hi>viz.

He ſays, <hi>The Soul and Body are not ſick and well together:</hi> Whereas I profeſs to think, they are ſick and well together, and that they have both one common Senſe, of Hearing, Seeing, Smelling, Taſting, Feeling, and that they both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or the Perſon, hath the ſame Perception, Fancy, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Will, and Memory; and they both have, or (which is the ſame thing) the Perſon hath the ſame Affections, or Paſſions of Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Luſt, Wrath and Fear. Theſe all are naturally ingrafted in the Perſon, and are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Incidents to the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Soul and Body; and that this Union is the moſt amicable, friendly, and pleaſing, that Men know to be enjoy'd in our Earthly World; and that the Body is ſo far from being a Priſon, or Cage for the Soul, that there is no other Place in the World, wherein the Soul delights, or wherein it can ſubſiſt, but in the Body; nor is there a Seperation, which we know in the Earthly World, that is more grievous or afflictive, than the Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Soul and Body is commonly found to be to the Perſon, who is a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of them both. Upon which Conſiderations I ſtand inclined to Affirm, That the Perſon who is a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Soul and Body, and thoſe his Two Conſtituent Parts, are generated together, are born, live, and grow together; are ſick, and well together; and ſo are pleaſed, and diſpleaſed, and love, and hate together; are joyful, ſorrowful, and fearful together; are honoured, and ſhamed together; they decline, and decay together; and yet the Out-ward Part ſomewhat ſooner and faſter than the Inward, and ſo they grow impotent, and helpleſs together, that they die together; and that laſtly, they ſhall riſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in that Univerſal Reſurrection, which ſhall be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the ſecond Appearing of our Lord JESUS
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107192:16"/>CHRIST, when he ſhall come to Judge the World.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here quotes 3 <hi>John</hi> 2. as ſerving to prove his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, where St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith to <hi>Gains, I wiſh above all things, that thou maiſt proſper, and be in health, even as thy Soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpereth.</hi> It is a common Practice for Men in their Letters to wiſh Health and Proſperity to their Correſpondents, and this the Apoſtle practiſes in this Text, and the Words <hi>Even as thy ſoul proſpereth,</hi> ſeem to intend, Even as <hi>Gains</hi> himſelf proſpereth, in the Faith and Profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>He quotes again for his Purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>I ſee another Law in my Members, warring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of my Mind.</hi> Which Text I conceive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no more, than the War which the Senſual Affections and Paſſions make againſt the Opinions and Dictates of the Rational Faculty, or Mind of the Man, which is viſibly known and perceived to continue in the Perſon, from the Cradle to the Grave; and prove no more a War betwixt the Soul and the Body, than Love and Hatred, Sorrow and Joy, or any other contrary Affections of the Man, may do. He quotes further for his Purpoſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Abſtain from fleſhly Lusts, which war against the Soul:</hi> Here the Word Soul, ſeems to intend the Man himſelf, or the Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, or Mind, of the Perſon. Then he concludes, <hi>That the Soul and Body, as they are Two Beings, diſtinct in Number, ſo are they in Nature.</hi> And thereupon I ſay, how well he hath proved, what he ſaith he hath proved, ſhall be left to the Readers of our Books to Judge.</p>
               <p>His Third Propoſition Affirms, That the Soul is a Being ſeperable from the Body, which he ſays, he intends to prove; and to that Purpoſe, <hi>P.</hi> 17. he quotes 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. where he ſays, St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls our Bodies, our <hi>Earthly Houſe;</hi> which the Text does not expreſly do, but ſays, <hi>We know, that if our Earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a Building of God, a Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> I do not here perceive a neceſſity of taking theſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107192:16"/>Words, <hi>Our Earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle,</hi> to ſignifie our Bodies, but find as much, or more Reaſon to conceive, that by thoſe Words our Apoſtle did intend the whole Fabrick of the Earth; in which, or upon which, the Men of that Age then lived, and we ſtill do live: We find ſufficient Scripture Teſtimony, to prove, <hi>That our Earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle, ſhall in the end be diſſolved;</hi> and for the ſhortning of the time, when this ſhall be done, and the ſpeedy coming of our Lord to Judgment, was a great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Saints Prayers at that Time; and I think divers good Men of that Time, held Opinion, That poſſibly they might live to the ſecond coming of our Lord, and howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did not expect, that He ſhould have ſo long delay'd His Coming, as we find by Experience He hath done, if we take <hi>Our Earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle,</hi> to ſignifie the Earth upon which we live, that ſeems to Agree well with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>We have a Building of God, not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.7. <hi>The Heavens and the Earth, which are now, are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire againſt the day of Judgment, and Perdition of ungodly Men; and then the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the Earth alſo, and the Works that are therein ſhall be burnt up. Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of Perſons ought ye to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs.</hi> He doth not ſay, If you expect your ſeperate Souls going to Heaven, you muſt live after that manner; but if you expect the fiery Diſſolution of that Earth, upon which ye now live, you have great reaſon to act as he there directs. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we, according to his Promiſe, look for a new Heaven, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs. Wherefore (Beloved) ſeeing ye look for ſuch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs.</hi> Thus he ſays, they muſt practiſe a Holy Life, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expectation of thoſe things, which were not to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107192:17"/>till Chriſt's ſecond Appearing, but then were expected and hoped for by the Saints, and Church of thoſe Times: And of theſe New Heavens and Earth, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ſpeak, when he ſays, <hi>We have a Building of God, a Houſe, not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Such a Houſe as the Hands of Men cannot make, the Pattern whereof is now in Heaven, and ſhall deſcend hither to be our Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at our Lord's ſecond Appearing: And theſe are the things which he ſaith are not ſeen, and yet are Eternal; but when that Change ſhall happen, they ſhall be both Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and Eternal: And for this we groan earneſtly, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be clothed upon with this Houſe of ours which is from Heaven, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. We that are in this Tabernacle [of the Earth upon which we live] do groan, being burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not for that we would be uncloathed, [or not deſiring that our Perſons ſhould be diſſolved by Death] but cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, that Mortality might be ſwallowed up of Life. This ſhews that he did not deſire Death, in hope of his Souls immediate going to Heaven, but rather he longed for Chriſt's ſecond Appearing, when all theſe things ſhall be performed; and thoſe which at that time are found alive upon Earth, ſhall not die, but be changed in a Moment, or twinkling of an eye, and ſo cloathed with their Houſes which are from Heaven, and by that means, their mortal Bodies ſhall put on Immortality, fulfilling our Apoſtles Words in this Text, <hi>Mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of Life:</hi> And this Change ſeems to be the cloathing, upon which he both intended and deſired; and it was a Practice of the Church of thoſe Times, as before is ſaid, to pray for the ſpeedy Coming of our Lord Jeſus, and Conſummation of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel. And thus I conceive, I have better Expounded our Apoſtles Text, and given a truer Meaning thereof, than Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will be found to have done, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thereupon, That this Text can give but a feeble Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the Opinion of the Souls ſeperate Subſiſtence.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 18. He further quotes <hi>Ver.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord, and walk by Faith, not by ſight; and therefore we are willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord.</hi> The Meaning of which may be, that we cannot be preſent with the Lord in our Fleſhly Bodies, which are ſubject to Corruption, whil'ſt they continue in their Natural State; and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Change, or Tranſlation of ſuch Earthly Bodies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of Glorious, or Heavenly Bodies, which ſhall be done when we are cloathed upon with our Houſe, or Houſes, which are from Heaven, by changing our Earthly Bodies into Heavenly; which ſhall be performed to the Saints that live upon Earth, at the Time of our Lord's ſecond Coming; and tho' they be abſent from the Lord in their Earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet they ſhall then be preſent with Him in their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ones. And our Apoſtle proceeding, ſays, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>We labour, that whether preſent or abſent, we may be accepted of Him:</hi> And then cloſes his Diſcourſe, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. with that which ſeems to be the Reaſon of all his Deſire and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his</hi> [Earthly] <hi>Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> Which intends, the Laſt and General Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any Pretence or Apprehenſion, that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Judgment, is at all meant or conſider'd in that Expreſſion. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes further, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>I think it meet, ſo long as I am in this Tabernacle, to ſtir you up, knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this Tabernacle, viz.</hi> I will endeavour, that after my Departure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſeems that <hi>Peter,</hi> by the Term Tabernacle, did intend his own Fleſhly Body, which with Propriety enough, may ſignifie that Humane Body, which is the Receptacle and Tabernacle of Life to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man: And Death is commonly amongſt us call'd a Departure out of this World, of ſuch Perſons, as lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were living Members of it; and therefore I do not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107192:18"/>perceive what Force there is in theſe Texts, of Proving the Soul's Seperate Subſiſtence: Nor do I perceive, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> lays any proving Weight upon the Senſe of the Texts, as they are here quoted, but endeavours rather to enforce a Meaning from the Greek Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which he ſays, Signifies, <hi>After my going out,</hi> viz. <hi>Out of my Tabernacle;</hi> although our Tranſlators have render'd it <hi>After my Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Which I think to be a Tranſlation, which he cannot mend; and if ſo they had render'd it, by, <hi>After my going out,</hi> I ſhould have ſooner have taken it to ſignifie, An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhment of the Vital Flame in his Body, than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of an Intelligent Subſtantial Soul out of it: And therefore I think, the Enforcement of this Argument, which he would derive from the Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is but trifling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 19 He Appeals to all Mens Judgments, that are not prejudicate, whether the Apoſtles do not by the quoted Texts, intend, That Mens Souls are of ſuch a Nature, as can ſubſiſt in a State of Seperation from their Bodies. I doubt not, but if I, or any other Man, ſhall declare our ſelves to think other ways; he will Reply we are Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and that is all the Fruit that can be expected of ſuch a needleſs Appeal.</p>
               <p>He ſays further, <hi>If theſe Apoſtles had believed the Soul and Body to die together, they would never have uſed ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Metaphorical Expreſſions as theſe, that do ſo clearly hold forth a Seperability of the one from the other.</hi> To this I Reply, That if at all they hold forth this Opinion, it is in a Dark-Lanthorn, with the Light Side towards him, and the Dark towards me: But I rather conceive, that if they had known the Being of a Subſtantial, Intelligent, Seperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subſiſting Soul in Man; and that thoſe of the good, went to Heaven preſently after the Death of the Perſon; they would probably and even certainly have preached, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſame: And we ſhould have found it ſo plainly and clearly delivered in ſome of their Writings, which are come
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107192:18"/>to our hands; and the not finding it ſo delivered in any of their Writings, gives us great cauſe to doubt the Truth of that Opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> for a further Proof of his Opinion, quotes 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1. where that Apoſtle relates a Trance or Viſion, which he had, and wherein he could not tell whether he was in the Body, or out of the Body; and thereupon he quotes the Aſſembly of Divines, which ſat in the Rump-Parliament Time; and that they ſay the Apoſtle doubted, whether God framed the Repreſentation of theſe Heavenly things in his Soul, in a State of Union with the Body, or whether God Seperated the Soul from the Body, and tranſported it into Heaven: And thereupon, <hi>P.</hi> 20. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That many Philoſophers, and ſome Divines, affirm, That</hi> Paul<hi>'s Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul might be ſeperated from the Body, and yet</hi> Paul <hi>not dead;</hi> profeſſing himſelf partly to be of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And if by being out of the Body, the Apoſtle doth not mean ſuch a Separation, he would be told what is meant by thoſe Words, <hi>Being out of the Body.</hi> He was Conſcious to himſelf of a common, and I think a ſufficient Anſwer thereunto given, <hi>viz.</hi> That St. <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt in a Trance or Extaſie of his Mind, wherein thoſe things which he ſaw and heard, were ſo lively repreſented to his Perceptive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and ſo throughly imprinted upon his Memory, as they could not be more perfectly perceived, or better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, if he had truly perceived them by the Uſe of his Bodily Organs, ſo as he could not certainly know, whether he was really wrapt into Heaven in his whole Perſon, or whether the ſame was only a Trance and Rapture of his Mind. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> intending to prevent this Anſwer, ſays, <hi>It is not enough for Men to offer that Anſwer to his Queſtion.</hi> And more to entangle the Matter, he propounds a New Queſtion, demanding, <hi>If it were an Extaſie, what was the Nature of that Extaſie?</hi> I Reply, I pretend not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to tell him the Nature of any Extaſie, Trance, or Viſion,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107192:19"/>which may happen to Men; becauſe I ſuppoſe them to be ſuper-humane Actions, inexplicable from the known or common Principles of Humane Nature: And therefore, without farther Anſwer to his Queſtion, about the Nature of an Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſie, I profeſs to Believe, that the Anſwer before given, <hi>viz.</hi> That St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in a Trance at that time, is enough, notwithſtanding his ſaying, <hi>That it is not enough;</hi> and that it will paſs for a good Anſwer and Solution of his firſt Queſtion, upon which all the reſt depends. I do not pretend to make ſuch Interpretations of difficult Scriptures, as are likely to ſatisfie all Peruſers, but count it enough, if thereupon I can ſatisfie my own Underſtanding: As to my beſt Judgment, I have done upon this Text, without being afraid of Mens Cenſures, of loſing the Meaning of ſuch a Dark Scripture, inſtead of Interpreting it. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> proceeds to ſay, <hi>Till I hear a better Senſe given of this Text of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>than I have here given of it, I will conclude from hence, that the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>doth imply, that his Soul, and ſo all other Mens Souls, are, whil'ſt in the Body, of ſuch a nature as may be ſeperated from the Body.</hi> To this I Reply, Our Author hath Power to take this Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in what Senſe he pleaſes, or thinks moſt reaſonable, as all other Readers may do, and may thence Infer, and Conclude, as their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Affections, or Prepoſſeſſions, ſhall perſwade them: But I profeſs my ſelf to conceive, they build upon ſandy Ground, who draw that Inference from the Relation of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Trance, or any other Text quoted to prove Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Third Propoſition, <hi>That the Soul can ſubſiſt in a State of Seperation from the Body;</hi> Becauſe I judge the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences by me produced, and my Conſtructions upon his Texts, do more clearly prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Fourth Propoſition is, that the Scriptures affirm, <hi>That when the Body dies, the Soul is actually ſeperated from it.</hi> In Proof of which, he quotes <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return to God
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107192:19"/>that gave it.</hi> Upon which he ſays, <hi>It is moſt clear, that by Duſt, is here meant the Body; and by Spirit, the Soul of Life in Man.</hi> In which Conſtruction I do not much differ from him, but do eaſily Agree, That by <hi>Duſt</hi> here, is meant the <hi>Body;</hi> and that by <hi>Spirit,</hi> is intended the <hi>Spirit of Life in Man:</hi> And thereupon I Obſerve, That theſe Words of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> are a ſingle and tranſient Expreſſion, concerning a Subject not mention'd in the reſt of the Chapter, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after, and without a particular Occaſion given, or offer'd, to ſpeak of the State of Souls after Death; and ſeems to have ſomething of a Chance in the delivery of it: And as I find no Introduction to this Expreſſion, nor Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given to ſpeak of a Rational or Intelligent Soul in Man; ſo I do not perceive, that they do either mention, or intend, the Spirit of Man to be ſuch a Soul, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pretends it to be. <hi>Solomon,</hi> was here treating concerning the Decays of Man's Life, and recounts by what degrees, Death makes its Approaches, till at laſt it prevails over the Perſon, and then <hi>the Duſt returns to the Earth,</hi> as it was, <hi>and the Spirit returns to God who gave it.</hi> And the Queſtion upon this Text ſeems to be, what is meant by the Term of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and what is meant of its <hi>Return to God who gave it.</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays, <hi>That by the Spirit is intended the Soul of Life.</hi> And I think, I differ not far from him, when I ſay, That by the Word Spirit, is intended the Spirit of Life: We know that <hi>Solomon</hi> had a careful Education, under a pious Father, and was endued with a ſtrong Inclination to ſearch out the Natures of Things; and thence we may certainly Conclude, that he had carefully peruſed, the Patriarchal Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> and the other <hi>Moſaical</hi> Writings, and there had found written, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Fleſh with the Life thereof, which is the Blood thereof, ſhall ye not eat; and ſurely the Blood of their Lives will I require, at the hand of every Beaſt will I require it; and at the hand of Man, at the hand of every Man's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will I require the Life of Man: Whoſo ſheddeth Man</hi>'s

Theſe Quotations ſeem to prove, that the Spirit of Life in Man, is a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Parts, as well as his Body, and that the Compoſition of ſuch Spirit of Life required, is, of Blood, and Breath: The Blood and Humours of their Bodies and their Spirits, are abſolutely neceſſary for the Life of Man and Beaſt, by maintaining and nouriſhing, the glowing, and yet lambent Flame of Life, which acts their Organical Bodies, and cauſes a continual Circulation of their Blood to that Purpoſe: and no leſs neceſſary for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and maintaining of Life, is that Breath, which God firſt breathed into <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſince hath communicated, and continued to all his Poſterity, which have been procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from that Time to this.

And thus the Spirit of Life in Man and Beaſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of the Breath of Life, and the Blood of our Lives acting by inflamed Spirits of the Blood, the whole Motion, and Power of the Body, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And this ſort of Spirit <hi>in Compoſito,</hi> is all the Spirit of Life, which yet I am able to perceive to be in Man or Beaſt; and this cauſes me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it muſt be Mortal: And that as it was procreated and born with the Body, ſo it muſt ceaſe at death with the Being of the Perſon, and be therewith raiſed again at the General Reſurrection of the Dead. Notwithſtanding the Evidence which I have produced, for the maintaining this Opinion, I reſt aſſured, my Oppoſers will maintain, That there muſt be another ſort of Soul or Spirit in Man, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and managing, his ſuper-excellent Faculties of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and Memory, becauſe they cannot perceive, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the <hi>Quomodo,</hi> or Manner how, this Material Soul, compounded of Breath, Blood, and the Spirits of it, acted by the Circulation thereof, can poſſibly produce the Effects and Operations laſt ſpecified.</p>
               <p>I do not perceive, that they very much boggle at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That theſe Ingredients may poſſibly produce, Life,

And thererfore I will not ſay much in the Proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which our daily Experience ſufficiently demonſtrates; our Senſe of Seeing often proving to us, that Men and Beaſts, by hanging, ſtrangling, drowning, or by other Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focations, or Stoppings of their Breath, are ſoon delivered over to the Dominion of Death; and thereby the Words of <hi>David</hi> are verified, <hi>When thou takeſt away their Breath, they die.</hi> And therewith ſhall be finiſh'd my preſent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: Whence I go on to enquire after <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Words of this Text, <hi>The Spirit returns to God who gave it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I dare not, and thefore I do not Affirm, That <hi>Solomon</hi> intended this ſort of Spirit, which I have deſcribed, to be truly that Spirit, which he ſays <hi>Returns to God who gave it;</hi> and with intent to give a Reaſonable Account thereof, I think fit to Premiſe, that there are Two other Sorts of Souls or Spirits, commonly taken notice of in the Learned World. The Firſt of which, and the moſt taken notice of, is that Sort Soul, which is often ſpoken of, and deſcribed by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Party; and which they ſay, is an entire, compleat, intelligent Spirit, acting the Organical Body whil'ſt it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in remains, and ſpecially the <hi>Kepheline</hi> Organs thereof; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing eminently therein, the high Faculties of, Perceiving, Underſtanding, Judgment, Will, and Memory; and they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107192:21"/>State, and therein, move it ſelf, and have full Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fore-named Powers of Reaſoning, Acting, and Thinking; and that very ſoon after its Seperation from the Body, it goes to God, or before His Tribunal, to receive his Intermediate Judgment, upon the Acts done by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Life Time; and that purſuant to the Sentence therein given, ſuch Souls are either accepted into Heaven, and Happineſs, or that they are caſt down to Hell, to be there made Partakers of Eternal Sufferings; and that they have Senſe, and Perception enough, to take a full Taſte of theſe great Differences: To which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church Annexes, That beſides the Souls that go to theſe Two Places, there are other Souls, which are ſent, ſome to <hi>Limbus</hi>'s, <hi>Paterum aut Puerorum;</hi> other to Paradiſe or <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom; and others (of which they think there are a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) into the ſcorching Flames of a Purgatorial Fire where they muſt undergoe great, yet Temporal Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for expiating the Crimes of their Dead Perſons, and Purging away that Droſs which they had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bodies of their Perſons upon Earth.</p>
               <p>The Second ſort of Soul, whereof notice is taken by the Learned, is ſuppoſed to have a different Original, riſing from an Opinion very antient in the World, which was, That the whole World it ſelf was one immenſe Living Creature, or Machine, animated or acted by one univerſal Soul, Spirit, or Being; which the old Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers termed, ſome of them the Soul of the World, and by others it was called the Spirit of Nature, which they ſo both deſcribed, as they appeared to intend an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal or infinite Spirit; from whence, or from whom, all the Life and Motion found in the World was derived. Some of thoſe Learned ſaid, That all the Life of Graſſes, Flowers, and Plants, was derived from that Spirit or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that upon their Dying, that Vegitable Spirit which before was in them, return'd again to the Spirit
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107192:22"/>of Nature, from whence it firſt proceeded. Others went not ſo deep, but contented themſelves to ſay, That the Spirit of Life in all thoſe Creatures which had ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Motion proceeded from this Soul of the World, or that univerſal Spirit or Being, which Animated or Acted the ſame; and they conceived, that when ſuch Creatures were duely fitted for the receipt of Life, this univerſally knowing Spirit, was moved by a Natural Congruity in the thing, to emit from it ſelf ſuch Sparks and Particles, as were parts of it's own Being, for the communicating and giving ſuch a Spirit of Life to thoſe Creatures, as their Natures required and that when ſuch Living Creatures Dyed, thoſe Sparks or Parcels of the Spirit of Life, which they had before received, return'd immediately back to the univerſal Spirit of the World; as to the Fountain from whence they iſſued; or as to that <hi>Totum,</hi> of which themſelves were but the ſmall Sparks or Particles; to which they were again joyned, and were received into it, as true and real Parts and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the ſame. This apprehenſion hath been of a long continuance in the World, coming down from the Diſcourſes of Ancient Philoſophers, to the time of the Divine <hi>Plato,</hi> by whom it was Cultivated and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; ſo as all his Doctrines and Writings ſeem to have reference thereunto, and taſte very ſtrongly of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and all his Scholars were much addicted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, even down to latter times; and the ſame Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to have a Being and Subſtance in the Minds of ſome learned Perſons, until this time. My Diſcourſe concerning this ſort of Spirit, hath been deliver'd with intent to diſcover and evince, That <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to God who gave it, was ſpoken and meant by him concerning this laſt ſort of Spirit, and I intend to recite ſome Arguments for the proving of this Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Firſt I Argue from the words or terms of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107192:22"/>Text it ſelf, and ſay, That it <hi>Solomon</hi> intended ſuch a Soul as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has deſcribed, the Text it ſelf ſeems not to be properly worded; becauſe I think nothing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to return to another thing, except it had been a part, or concomitant of that other thing before; but Mr. <hi>W.</hi>'s ſort of Soul, ſeems never to have been a part or concomitant of God before its being put into the Body, for the enlivening and acting of the Perſon; I do not therefore well perceive, how ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul can be properly ſaid to return to God: but the Expreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto properly belonging, ſhould have been worded, The Spirit goes to, or goes before God, with expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to receive his Judgment and Sentence, according to the demeanour of its Perſon upon Earth; and I do not perceive how this Souls going to God for Judgment, can be properly call'd a return to God who gave it. Secondly, I Argue, I find not ſo much as one Text in Scripture, which ſays, the Souls of dying Perſons go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to God for Judgment, nor any Text from whence this Opinion may be drawn, by a rational Inference; and that which makes neareſt approaches to it of any that I know, is the Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> where it is ſaid, the Begger died and was carried by Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom. I know my Oppoſers will think it needleſs to ask them, what is intended by the words, The Begger was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom; and doubt not but they will ſoon make a bold Anſwer: It neither was, nor could be the Begger himſelf, that was ſo carried in his whole Perſon, Body and Soul, into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Boſom; and yet the Words of the Text, ſeem to import, that his whole Perſon, Soul and Body was carried thither: But if we ſhall grant their gloſs upon this Text to be true, that his Soul only was carried by Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, we may draw theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from that Relation, either that his Soul was ſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107192:23"/>ignorant, as it knew not how to find a way to that Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or elſe was ſo weak and impotent, as it was not able to paſs thither, without the Support and Miniſtry of Angels. How then can we conceive, that ſuch a Soul as this, ſhould make its return to God preſently upon the Death of its Perſon, without mention of any other Aſſiſtance to be given it? We hear nothing of <hi>Dives</hi> in the Parable, but that being in Hell, he lift up his Eyes and ſaw <hi>Lazarus</hi> in another place, without mention of the means by which he came there; and if we ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the common Conjecture, that as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried to one place by Angels, ſo <hi>Dives</hi> was hurried to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Devils; it will appear very unlikely, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi>'s ſort of Soul, is able to make its way, and return to God at its Pleaſure: And here we Read the Begger's Soul was carried by Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mention of its being carried or returning to God at all; whence it ſeems probable, that when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the Souls returning to God, he doth not intend ſuch a Soul as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath deſcribed, but rather ſuch a Spirit as had firſt been a part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> parcel of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pirit of Nature, or of God, ſent out for the enlivening and acting of a particular Perſon, upon whoſe Death that Spark or Parcel of the Deity returns with a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to God who ſent it out from himſelf, for the enlivening <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, I Argue, That if <hi>Solomon</hi> had intended by the Words, <hi>Returns to God who gave it,</hi> a going of the Soul to God, or before God, for receiving the Doom of his intermediate Judgment, it ſeems a matter of ſuch great Moment, as required a more full Diſcourſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107192:23"/>upon the ſame, and giving us more Light in it, than his very few words there do afford us. And however, it is very probable, that he would not have immediately ſubjoyned to his Diſcourſe, which intimates an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Judgment, a Declaration and Deſcription of the General Judgment, for that would have been playing Judgment upon Judgment, which muſt needs have paſt for falſe Heraldry. We find in this Chapter, that as ſoon as <hi>Solomon</hi> had writ the Words, <hi>The Spirit returns to God who gave it,</hi> he ceaſes to ſpeak any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the State of Man after Death, till he come to the 14th, or laſt verſe of the Chapter, where he ſayes as a concluſion of his whole matter, <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments, for God will bring every work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> I think it not reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that <hi>Solomon</hi> by his <hi>Returning of the Spirit to God who gave it,</hi> did intend ſuch a returning to God, to be a going to him, or before him, for an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Judgment; for that if he had ſo intended, he would not have immediately have mentioned and related the Certainty and Effect of the General Judgment, as in this we ſee plainly he hath done: and thus I leave <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Words, and the deſcant upon them, to the further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Judgment of the Intelligent Reader.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> goes on to quote <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3 20. Where he ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> affirms, that the Spirit of a Man goeth upward when he dieth, adding that <hi>Solomon</hi> brings it in with an Intrrogation, <hi>Who knoweth?</hi> Not as if he doubted it, for he cannot be ſaid to doubt it, ſince he delivered it moſt poſitively in the other verſe, intending as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Text laſt before quoted out of his 12th Ch. Hereupon I again declare, I am no way ſatisfied with the manner uſed by our Author in his Quotations of Scripture. The Text which in this place he quotes, ſays
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107192:24"/>thus, <hi>Who knoweth the Spirit of Man that goeth upward, and the Spirit of the Beaſt that goeth downward to the Earth?</hi> Which to my underſtanding hath the ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as if he had ſaid, Who knows the certain Truth of this Opinion, <hi>That the Spirit of Man goeth upward, and the Spirit of the Beaſt goeth downward to the Earth?</hi> Or who knows whether this difference between the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Men and Beaſts be real and true or not? And further it ſeems to me, that this Interrogation is Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a Negative, and ſeems to have the ſame ſenſe, as if had ſaid, No Man certainly knows whether there be ſuch a difference between the Spirits of Men and Beaſts or not. Alſo this Interrogation ſeems to be the Product of a mature Deliberation, had and made by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> upon this point: for in the foregoing verſes, he had compared the Natures of Men and Beaſts together, and plainly affirms, That Men may ſee that they themſelves are Beaſts, [and as to their Natural State may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Beaſts that periſh.] One thing befals both Beaſts and Men, <hi>For as the one dieth, ſo dieth the other; yea they have all one Breath; ſo that a Man hath no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence above a Beaſt, all go to one place; for all are of the duſt, and all turn to duſt again.</hi> And then conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des his Speculation with the quoted Text, <hi>viz. Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Spirit of Man that goeth upward, and the Spirit of the Beaſt that goeth downwards to the Earth?</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, that notwithſtanding this Intrrogation, <hi>Solomon</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That the Spirit of Man goeth upwards when he Dieth; whereas I hold it plain to every Reader, that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not affirm ſo. Our Author replies, He can prove that <hi>Solomon</hi> doth affirm ſo; for that in the Text before quoted out of his 12th, Chap. <hi>The Spirit [of Man returns to God who gave it:]</hi> Which muſt be taken in the ſame Senſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if he had ſaid, it goes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And hereunto I Anſwer, That there are Eight
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107192:24"/>Chapters between his Third and Twelfth; and <hi>Solomon</hi> might well enough be in doubt, when he writ his Third Chapter, and yet be reſolv'd thereupon, before he writ his laſt Chapter; or perhaps his Text quoted out of that Chapter, might be Tranſiently or Curſorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, without ſo much deliberation, upon the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Point, as that which he had before uſed, in his Third Chapter, and the Concluſion now quoted of that Conſideration; and it ſeems ſomewhat clear to me, that there is a great difference between theſe two Texts of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s: The firſt after a deliberate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Point, declares plainly, that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein; and the laſt, without any deliberate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration (which appears in the Text) pronounces tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently, and in a very vew words; <hi>The Spirit returns to God who gave it.</hi> And whether of theſe two Texts Men will believe; alſo, in what manner, and in what ſenſe they think it requiſite to believe them, I leave to be further determined by my Peruſers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 22. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> for further Proof of this Point, quotes 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.17. Which in our Tranſlation runs thus, <hi>The Son of the Woman. the Miſtreſs of the Houſe, [where Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah had been well entertained] fell ſick, and his ſickneſs was ſo ſore, that there was no Breath left in him.</hi> Verſe 21, 22. <hi>Elijah cried unto the Lord, and ſaid, I pray thee let this Child's Soul come into him again; and the Soul of the Child came into him again, and he revived.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Says, the ſame Hebrew Word is uſed in this place, which is uſed in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>For the Breath of Life,</hi> and he Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, That our Tranſlators have rendred it in both thoſe places, by the term of Breath; and he tells us, that <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> tells him, that this Hebrew Word ſignifies the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and always the Soul of a Man, never tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of a Beaſt; and ſays, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> underſtand thereby, the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Immortal Soul of Man; by which Word, they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107192:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>uſed in a way of Reverence to Swear. Hereupon I obſerve, That if the <hi>Jews</hi> believed, this Term ſignified the Soul of Man did Swear by it, they were in a groſs Error, as I doubt <hi>Buxtorf</hi> was, when he expreſſed himſelf to think there was a Rational Immortal Soul in Man. Then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, He wonders our Tranſlators ſhould in this Text, and that of <hi>Gen.</hi> ſo obſcure this Word, in rendering it by the Word Breath, of ſo Dark and Ambiguous a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification; but in this Cenſure, I think Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, becauſe I conceive the ſignification of the Word Breath, in Engliſh, is as little ambiguous or doubtful, as thoſe of any other ordinary Words, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed amongſt us. Then he lays blame upon our Tranſlators of the Scriptures, for not having well performed their Duty, <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe they have not Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated them in ſuch a manner as would better have ſerv'd his purpoſe. He does not pretend from his own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or that of <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> that the Hebrew Word here quoted, doth not ſometimes ſignifie Breath, as well as Spirit or Soul; and if the Word have ſuch a double Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, as ſometimes to ſignifie Breath, and ſometimes Spirit, as the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> hath in the Greek Tongue, then our Tranſlators it ſeems have acted very imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for that in <hi>verſe</hi> 17. they have rendred this Hebrew Word by the Term Breath, as they have done <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. And in <hi>verſe</hi> 21.22. of <hi>Kings,</hi> they have rendred this Hebrew Word by the Term Soul; and therefore I think they little deſerve the blame, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> lays upon them; but that their Tranſlation may and ought, to retain that Reverence and Authority, which for many Years, and ſome Ages, it hath maintained amongſt us; and which I hope it will not be in the Power of M. <hi>W.</hi> or Mr. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> to diminiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By this Collection, it appears, that if our Tranſlators had rendred this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Term by the Word Breath, in <hi>verſes</hi> 21. and 22.

(as it ſeems they might warrantably enough have done) the words would have run thus, <hi>Lord I pray thee let this Child's Breath come into him again; and the Breath of the Child came into him again, and he revived.</hi> This reading would have taken all manner of pretence of Mr. <hi>W.</hi>'s proving the Souls Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Subſiſtence by this Text: And thereupon, I am ready to profeſs, that this mode of proving the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, from the Modes of ſpeaking, or the Phraſiology, of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> or any other Nation, ſeems to be a weak ſort of proceeding to that purpoſe. The Spirit of Life in Man (of whatſoever ſort it be) is Natural and Subſtantial; and if its Subſtance in a State of Seperation be true, the proper and expected Poofs thereof, might and ought to be drawn from Texts of Scripture, which are ſomewhat clearly aſſertory of the ſame; ſuch as I agree, St. <hi>Matt.</hi>'s Words, are notable to kill the Soul: But withal, I pretend, that there is not in all the whole Bible, one other Text, which hath ſo much clearneſs of aſſertation in this Point, as this Text of St. <hi>Matth.</hi> hath, not agreeing, That <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Return of the Soul to God who gave it,</hi> carries alike clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Evidence with it, That St. <hi>Matt</hi>'s doth; however it appears, that the Opinion of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, leans mainly upon theſe two Pillars, altho' they ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unequal, and the one of them much ſtronger than the other: To the one of them, I have late before anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and may do to the other in due time.

                  </gap>, in this Text, may, and doth, indifferently ſignifie, ſometimes Breath, and ſometimes Spirit, according as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Subject matter of that Diſcourſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is uſed: And I do not blame our Tranſlators for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107192:26"/>rendering it in this place, by the Engliſh Word <hi>Spirit.</hi> But then I intend, that if it be ſo well rendred, yet in this place, it may have, and likely hath, a Tropical Signification, by a very uſual <hi>Synecdoche, Partis pro toto;</hi> by the Word <hi>Spirit,</hi> intending his, whofe Perſon now Dying, he knew very well, that his whole Perſon, Body and Soul, were to riſe again upon the Sunday Morning, after his Crucifixion, which was finiſhed upon the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the Evening, after Three of the Clock: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, we Read, he was ſo raiſed on Sunday Morning at the very break of Day, in his whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, both Soul and Body; the very ſame that Died, was then Raiſed by Divine Power. Whence I Collect, our Lord recommended to his Father, all that was after to be Raiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> His whole Perſon, Soul and Body, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and intended, by the Word or Term of <hi>Spirit.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes further, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.57. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which might well enough have been thus Tranſlated, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Breath ſpent in the laſt moment of my life, in maintaining the truth of thy Goſpel.</hi> Altho' I do not deny, that our verſion, by the Word <hi>Spirit,</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a good Tranſlation of the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but then I pretend, it muſt be taken in the like Figurative Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as it was intended before, in our Lords Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, in both theſe places, he takes the Word <hi>Spirit</hi> to ſignifie, that Spirit (fore-kind) which God breathed into Man at firſt, when he became a Living Soul [or Perſon] and ſo do I take it; but our difference is about what ſort that Spirit was, which God breathed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby he became a Living Perſon. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to be no more than a moderate Portion of the Ambient Air, which by facing the Blood and Humours, then turgid and fitted for that Operation, might kindle the Flame of Life amongſt them, and ſhould after by Reſpiration keep the ſame in a glowing or flaming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107192:26"/>or circulation, ſo long as the life of the Perſon ſhould endure; but Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pretends, That God breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Adam</hi>'s Noſtrils a Newly Created, Entire, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, Intelligent Spirit, which had a Subſiſtence of its own, before its being breathed into <hi>Adam</hi>'s Noſtrils; and ſhall have a like Subſiſtence of its own again, at, or after the Diſſolution, or Death of the Perſon. At the beginning of this Fourth Propoſition, he promiſed (and I believe intended) to prove the Seperate Subſiſtence of his ſort of Soul. He hath not yet (to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) performed it, but how well he hath aquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of that Deſign or Intention, by his Mediums of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recited in this Propoſition, ſhall be left to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our indifferent Readers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 23 Mr. <hi>W.</hi> delivers his Fifth Propoſition, which is, That the Souls of Men ſeperated from their Bodies by Death, are in Joy or Miſery: And for the Proof of this Aſſertion, he quotes two, and but two Paſſages out of the Bible; the firſt of which, is our Lords Promiſe to the Thief upon the Croſs, That he ſhould be with him that Day in Paradiſe: Upon which he ſays, neither <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> nor the Thief were that Day in Body there, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be there in Soul only. Upon which I obſerve a diſagreement in my Mind, from that which he firſt affirms; conceiving it probable, That their Bodies and Souls might both be preſent in Paradiſe that Day; but then I do not confine the Term of that Day, to the ſignification of an Artificial or Natural Day; the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing but during the Light of one Day, and the other containing the ſpace of Twenty four Hours only, and no more. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95 8. <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi> Heb. 3.13. <hi>Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day:</hi> And there quotes <hi>Davids To Day,</hi> as if it intended the Forty Years Travel in the Wilderneſs. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. <hi>Chriſt wept over
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107192:27"/>Jeruſalem, and ſaid, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>A thouſand Years with God, are but as one Day.</hi> And the Prophets often denoted, the ſpace of a Year by one Day. More like Teſtimonies might be Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of Scripture, to prove, that when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by his Prophet, ſpeaks of a Day, they do not tye up the Signification thereof, to the preciſe time of an Artificial or Natural Day; but do intend, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a competent ſhort time, ſuch things ſhall come to paſs, and I do not pretend to prolong the Signification of our Lords <hi>to Day,</hi> in Mr <hi>W.</hi>'s quoted Text, beyond Sunday; for they were Crucified upon Friday, in the Evening, and the one Died, and the other might well enough riſe up on Sunday Morning, and that Morning our Lord appeared firſt to <hi>Mary Magdalene;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 20.17. In Diſcourſe ſaid unto her, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father.</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>The ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the week, came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt [of his Apoſtles] and ſhewed them his hands and his ſide,</hi> Luke 24.38. Says the Diſciples, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of our Lord's appearing, <hi>And he ſaid unto them; Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf; handle me, and ſee, for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi> From theſe Relations I Collect, That after our Lords appearing to <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> he did Aſcend to his Father, and might then alſo go to that Paradiſe intended for the Thief; and that in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Day he appeared in the Aſſembly of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and ſaid to them, <hi>Handle me and ſee,</hi> [or perceive] <hi>for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones [as ye may feel me have.]</hi> Hence I infer, That our Lord had been in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Paradiſe on the very Day of his Reſurrection; and after his return from thence, offer'd himſelf to be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107192:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>handled and felt, by his Diſciples, altho' before his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending thither, he would not ſuffer <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> to touch him. And this I think proves our Lord to have been in Paradiſe, in ſo ſhort a time after his Promiſe to the Thief, as might well be called to Day. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Thief, I obſerve, That he Died likewiſe upon Friday Evening, and that from thence to Sunday Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Body might remain apparent, without liklihood of being tainted. We read, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.52. <hi>The Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the Graves, after [our Lords Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction] and went into the holy City, and appeared unto many. Arguendo</hi> from theſe Teſtimonies, I think it likely, that the Body of our Thief, was one of theſe Bodies of Saints which came out of their Graves, after Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and his Body ſo chang'd, (as at, or in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection) might, and probably did, aſcend with our Lord into that Paradiſe, which before was promis'd him, and was there with our Lord, both preſent with their Souls and Bodies, or their whole Perſons, in ſuch manner as they had before lived in this World. And thus Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, I have given a Reaſonable, and I think a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer to all thoſe Inferences and Arguments, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath raiſed from this Text; which therefore I decline to examine any further in this place, knowing we ſhall meet with the ſame afterwards; and that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in the Progreſs of his Treatiſe, doth repeat over again this and divers others of thoſe Arguments, which he hath made Parcel of his Five Propoſitions. I therefore now proceed to Examine his laſt Quotation, for the Proof of Souls being Rewarded or Puniſhed preſently after their departure out of the Bodies. For the further Proof of which Aſſertion, he quotes, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19. Where the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> is at large Related; and thereupon ſays little more, but that he concludes from the Contents of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107192:28"/>this Parable, That the Souls of Men (ſeperate at Death from their Bodies) enter into a State of Joy or Miſery, before the Reſurrection. Obſerving upon which, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give ſome Reaſons, why he ought not ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. Firſt, becauſe the Relation in this Place, is but of a Parable Similitude; the Nature whereof is not to prove, but Illuſtrate the Subject upon which Men are then Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing; and therefore his Practice is not Reaſonable in making choice to prove by a <hi>Medium,</hi> whoſe Deſign is not to teach, but repreſent things in ſuch a manner as they may be better received, by thoſe to whom the Diſcourſe is Proſecuted. Secondly, I ſay, There appears no Deſign in this Parable, to teach or inſtruct our Lord's Auditors concerning the true State or Nature of Men after Death; becauſe in the Context to this Parable, there is no Queſtion raiſed or Diſcourſe held concerning that Subject: Whence I conceive, the intent of this Parable was not to confirm or illuſtrate the Speculation thereof; but that rather this Parable was offer'd to illuſtrate and confirm, an Aſſertion, which our Lord in the fore-going verſes had deliver'd, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 15 When the Phariſees had derided our Lords Doctrine, he Anſwers them, <hi>Ye are they which juſtifie your ſelves before Men, but God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your Hearts; for that which is chiefly eſteemed amongſt Men, is an abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> Soon after which our Lord delivers this Parable, and therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes <hi>Dives</hi> as in a very high manner enjoying the Glory and Good things of this World, and counted one of the happieſt amongſt Men; and then ſets out <hi>Lazarus</hi> in as low and miſerable a Condition, as Men commonly can fall to: Whence the State of <hi>Dives,</hi> was very highly eſteemed amongſt Men, but was in the Sight of God much otherwiſe, and placed far below the Condition of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in reſpect of thoſe future Enjoyments, which God had appointed for him. The Parable therefore I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107192:28"/>conceive was a very ſufficient illuſtration of our Lord's Aſſertion, before-mentioned; and I think was not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to teach or diſcover the true State of Men after Death: and then if we ſuppoſe, that Parables confirm or illuſtrate thoſe Diſcourſes only, which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo to aſſert; it ſeems inferrible, that this Parable, may not reaſonably be made good a Ground or Proof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true State of Men after Death, or that they receive rewards before the Reſurrection; becauſe it was not ſpoken with intent to teatch or illuſtrate that Point.</p>
               <p>A Third Argument againſt the alledging this Parable as a Proof, is the apparent Incongruity which it hath, <hi>With Solomon's return of the Spirit to God who gave it.</hi> Becauſe the return there ſpoken of, ſeems to be deliver'd as an effect of the Souls Natural Inclination, as a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done, and eaſie to be performed; and ſays, <hi>It is a return made to God who gave it.</hi> From which our Parable differs in Material Points: For the Parable doth not ſay, That <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or his Soul, either returned or went to God, for Judgment or any other purpoſe. Next, The Parable doth not ſay, That <hi>Lazarus</hi> or his Soul went any whither, but that he was carried by Angels, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or to Judgment, but into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom; a place of repoſe and ſome meaſure of happineſs: So as we may ſay of theſe two Proofs, tho' they be the main Pillars of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, yet their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies do not agree together.</p>
               <p>We Read that at our Lords Trial before <hi>Pilate,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers falſe witneſſes appeared, to give their Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Lord, whoſe Teſtimonies yet were finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, becauſe they agreed not together; <hi>Mark</hi> 14.56. <hi>Many bare falſe witneſs againſt our Lord, but their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were rejected, becauſe they agreed not together.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law required two witneſſes for the putting any Man to Death. And for this Reaſon I think our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107192:29"/>to be but a weak Proof of the Souls Seperate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, or immediate Reward after Death.</p>
               <p>A Fourth Argument oppoſing the proving Power of this Parable, rifes from the difficulty of finding Truth in the Words of it; for that it ſays, <hi>Dives afar off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Lazarus in Abraham's Boſom, and between the places of their aboad, there was a great Gulf fixed, ſo as none can paſs from the one of them to the other.</hi> This to my Underſtanding, ſeems ſomewhat incredible. Firſt, that <hi>Dives</hi> at ſuch a diſtance, ſhould be able to diſcover <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> as to know him: Next that <hi>Dives</hi> in his place of Torment, ſhould be able ſo to Speak and Diſcourſe as that <hi>Abraham</hi> could hear what he ſaid, and return An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I obſerve upon this Parable, That <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dives</hi> ſeem very well acquainted and nearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, one to the other: <hi>Dives</hi> gives <hi>Abraham</hi> the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Father, which <hi>Abraham</hi> accepts, and returns An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to him by the Name of Son; whereas (if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays true) there could be no ſuch real Relation between them: For Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, There was nothing of <hi>Dives</hi> in Hell but his Soul, ſubſiſting there, in a State of Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his Body: And this ſort of Soul is in no manner Propagated, by the Parents, but it is a New and Pure Creature, Created by God, at the firſt Procreation of every Perſon; having a Subſiſtence of its own, until it be by God injected into the newly procreated Body; where it preſently becomes Tainted and Defiled, with Original Sin. We will leave that to fall out as it may, but here I ſay, That this Soul not Generated or Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any of his Poſterity, can by no means be properly or truly Stiled the Son of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And from all theſe Arguments and Promiſes, I find my ſelf apt to Collect, that there is little Real or Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truth, in this Parable; that it very weakly proves the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107192:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>Seperate Subſiſtence of Souls, or their receiving Rewards or Puniſhments, before the Second Coming of our Lord to Judgment, and the Reſurrection of the Dead.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 24. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> cloſes up his Fifth Propoſition, with theſe Words, <hi>Having cleared up the five Propoſitions from diverſs Scriptures, he wonders at the Confidence of ſuch Men as dare pretend to perſwade People, that we have no clear Scripture to found the Belief of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality on.</hi> I Anſwer, That his Confident Sayings which prove not, I willingly paſs by, and from the woes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt his Oppoſers, and Shield my ſelf by the Words of <hi>Solomon, The Woe's pronounced without good cauſe, or the Curſe cauſe leſs ſhall not come.</hi>

                  <hi>PAge</hi> 26. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>A Man may be truly ſaid to know God.</hi> I Reply, If he thereby mean, the knowings of God is, or <hi>Quod ſit Deus,</hi> I grant it; but if he mean it of the <hi>Quid ſit Deus,</hi> or that Man knows what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Being God is, I then deny it. He thinks if he can deſcribe the Properties or Attributes of a Soul, from which we feel the Operition of Life, ſpring in us, he ſhall thereby give us ſufficiently to know what the Soul of Man is. I Reply, That Men aſcribe Attributes and Properties to God, upon the Certainty or Knowledge that they have, or may have, from divers clear To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, that there is ſuch a Being as God in the World, but the like manner of Proceeding will not ſerve to prove the Being of ſuch a Soul in the World, as he deſcribes; and therefore I do require of him or any other, who undertakes this Province, firſt to prove that really and truly there is ſuch a ſort of Soul in the Humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as he pretends; and if that be not firſt done, they can but aſcribe what Attributes and Properties they pleaſe,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107192:30"/>to they know not what, or to ſuch a thing, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove to have any Being at all, which is quire other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in the Caſe put by him before, concerning God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 27. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Soul is not the Breath of Man.</hi> Thereby it ſeems intending, That the Word Breath is not Equipollent to the Word Soul [of Man] and this I grant him, That the Breath of Man is not his Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I conceive there goes more parts to make up the Soul or Spirit of Man's Life. The Five Inferences which he pretends to draw from the Soul's being the Breath, I paſs over as not greatly material.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 28. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>Secondly, That as the Soul of Man is not the Breath, ſo it is not the Blood;</hi> and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, That if Blood be the Soul of Man, all the Food it hath to live upon is the Bread that Periſheth. I Reply, That all the Food that Man hath to live upon Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is the Bread that Periſheth, or is the nouriſhment which he duly obtains to that purpoſe, and thereby is the Spirit of his Life daily ſupported, and upon the failure or not obtaining thereof, the Man muſt Languiſh, Conſume and Die; and he, and his Spirit of Life or Soul, go out of the World, and be Extinct together. Further I conceive, The Man, his Spirit of Life or Soul, hath no other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Nouriſhment, but Viands of the kind before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. His following Expreſſions ſeems to be altogether Figurative. He offers, That if Blood were the Humane Soul, Lectures out of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> would be more proper to Purge away Sin, and bring Souls to Chriſt, then Sermons out of the Bible. Here I ſuppoſe by Souls he intends Perſons, or begs the Queſtion now in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute between us. Seeing he well knows, I give no credit to the Being of ſuch a Soul, as he very poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: And this being premiſed, I ſay, That Purifying and Purging the Blood, may very much help and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Humane Underſtanding; and Sermons out of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107192:30"/>Bible, may be very good helps and directions to the Man, in the government of his Affections, and the performing of his Duty to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 29. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Argues and Says, If the Soul be the Blood, then that a Man of Sixty Years of Age, has not the ſame Soul he had at Fifteen; and then how can you think this Old Man can be guilty of the Sins of his Youth? I Reply, That a Man's Soul is always of the ſame Nature and Kind; and tho the material parts of it, do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remain the ſame, yet the Man remains always the ſame Perſon, from Four to Fourſcore, and liable to anſwer for the Faults which he had long before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Then he tells me, that which I ſtill profeſs not to believe, tho' he doth tell it me; That the Soul is of a different Nature from the Body, and doth neither grow with it in Youth, nor Decay with it in Age, but remains in one ſame State and Power, during all the State of our Lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 30. He pretends to prove this by a Similitude, which I think to be foreign to our Queſtion, and adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Proof of his Aſſertion; and the like I think may be ſaid of his letting of Sheeps and Man's Blood into one another, reciprocally, and therefore I paſs them both over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 31. He ſays further, That as the Soul of Man is neither his Breath nor Blood, ſo it is not God, or any part of his Divine Eſſence: In all which I am ready to agree with him, having before declared and deſcribed, what manner of thing I think the Spirit of Life in Man to be; and that in its cohabitation with the Body, it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Growth and Decay, Health and Sickneſs, Strength and Weakneſs, Joy and Sorrow, and receives in the end an Extinguiſhment at the Death of the Perſon, or that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhment it ſelf is Death.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:107192:31"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Soul of man is guilty of Inadvertency, Raſhneſs, Folly.</hi> I do not agree with him in this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But if he had ſaid, The Perſon or the Man is ſubject to theſe Infirmities, I ſhould ſoon have agreed with him in that; becauſe I have often ſaid, I have no Conception, of a Man without a Soul, or of a Soul without a Man; but think, that to act or ſuffer any thing, they muſt be both together: And I Appeal to the Intelligent World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſuch Experience as Men can attain therein, they do not find it ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 32. Mr, <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Soul is a Spirit, created of God, and indued with Senſe and Reaſon, and a Power of actuating an Humane Body, by Vital <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 33. For the prooving of a Spirit to be a Subſtance, and that a Humane Soul is ſuch a Subſtance, he refers his Readers to all that he hath ſaid; or ſhall ſay, to prove the Soul is a Being, independent on the Body. I Reply, That as far as I am able to judge, all that he hath hitherto ſaid, ſeems very inſufficient for that Purpoſe; and what he will, or can ſhew, to perſwade the Belief of that Opinion, Time muſt ſhew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 34. he ſays, <hi>We feel in our Soul, a Power of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> which being thus worded, I deny my Aſſent thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: But had he ſaid, That a Man feels, or finds a Power of Thinking in himſelf, I ſhould have eaſily agreed with him in it. He ſays, <hi>The variety of Thoughts or Acts of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are the Soul's Motion.</hi> I ſay, They are Motions or Actings in the Mind of Man, effected, by acting the inflam'd Spirits of the Blood, working in the <hi>Kepheline</hi> Organs; in the which, the Great Artificer, GOD, framed and placed them, and to that Purpoſe, gave them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Power to perform ſuch Actions, when He created the Fabrick of the Humane Body, and breathed into its Noſtrils the Breath of Life, whereby the Spirits of the Blood and Humours became inflamed, for acting in a Body
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107192:31"/>to ſuch Purpoſes; and by ſuch an Excellent and Artificial Compoſition, always to be continued by Reſpiration. God's excellent Wiſdom and Power, did in the beginning produce theſe Workings amongſt ſuch <hi>Kepheline</hi> Organs, and gave them in this <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> Power to produce Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, Fantaſie, Judgment, Will, Memory, Affections, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Motions, and all other Powers or Faculties of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Mind or Perſon whatſoever. I know that upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Diſcourſe, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Party, will all cry out, How can theſe things be? That unintelligent, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Materials, working amongſt, or together with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſhould be able to produce Life, Senſe, Affections, Perception, Intellect, Memory, in the Perſon; demanding of me on Account or Declaration, how ſuch things can with any Probability, be effected by the working together of ſuch Materials. And I Anſwer, That the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of ſuch an Operation, is a Speculation too ſublime and curious, for the Wit of Man to compaſs or obtain. The Artifice of the Humane Machine, cannot be throughly penetrated, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, by the ſublimeſt Wits amongſt Men; witneſs the doubtings, both of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> diſcover'd in their Diſcourſes, upon the Points now in Queſtion. That God hath Wiſdom, and Skill ſufficient, to produce Intelligence, by means of Material Operations, ſeems true, and ſomething clear to my Underſtanding; and but few of our Oppoſers do deny, ſomewhat a like Artifice and Operation in the Brutal Nature. They ſeem ready to Agree, That God by his Wiſdom, and Skill, uſed in the Fabrication of the Brutes, hath in the beginning, produced, and doth ſtill produce, Life, Motion, Senſations, Affections, inward Perceptions, Phantafie, Choice, and Memory, by the Medium before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> The moving and acting of ſuch Spirits of the Blood, in the <hi>Kephaline,</hi> and other Organical Parts of their Bodies, without ſuch an entire, intelligent Spirit, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will needs ſuppoſe to be in Man. Daily Experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107192:32"/>us, That the Life, Motions, Senſations, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Brutes, are as true, ſtrong, vigorous, and active, as they are in Men; altho' their inward Perceptions, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, Choice, and Memory, fall ſhort of the like Faculties in Men, by divers degrees, or gradations; which I think may very probably come to paſs, by the difference in their <hi>Kephaline</hi> Organs, which are framed more aptly for ſuch Purpoſes, in Men, than in Beaſts. Whence we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the difference between them in this Point, riſes not ſo much from the diverſity of the Spirits, which move and act them, as from the difference and degrees of Perfection, amongſt their Organs, which are ſo to be acted. For Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of which Poſition, we may farther conſider the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks of their Bodies, and thereupon we muſt find, that Humane Bodies have Advantage above the Brutal, in two Particular Members, <hi>viz.</hi> their Hands and Tongue; of which Members, and their Activity, if Humane Bodies were deprived, they would be much more like the Beaſt that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, than now they are; and yet Men do not uſe to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, from theſe Bodily Advantages, that their Fleſh, Blood, Bones, or Breath, have a different Nature, or Conſtitution, from thoſe of Beaſts: But People are generally content to ſay with <hi>Solomon,</hi> That the Corporeal Conſtitutions of Man and Beaſt, are of a Similar Nature and Conſtitution, one of them with the other: Whence it ſeems to me probable, That although the Spirits Act with greater Perfection, the Heads, and Brains of Men, than they do among Beaſts; yet that hinders not, but that they may all be acted, by Spirits of a Similar Nature, one of them to another. And thus Arguing, I pretend to have ſhewn, that the Minds of Men are more likely to be Acted by the Inflamed Spirits of the Blood and Brain, than by an Intelligent Spirit, created by God for that Purpoſe; and yet it is ſtill apparently true, that Men are not able to give an Account of the Mode or Manner of the Production of ſuch Powers in the Mind of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107192:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>Man, by the Motions or Actings of thoſe Spirits in his Brain; that I conclude to be the <hi>Arcanum Opificis,</hi> and that none other can tell, or find out how the ſame is perform'd. And hereupon, I incline to rebut upon my Oppoſers, with their own Argument, and to demand of them, How, or by what means, or after what manner, their Intelligent Soul can; or doth Move and Act the Body, and the ſeveral Organs and Members thereof? having found them all hitherto confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that themſelves do not know, and therefore cannot declare to others, the certain, or likely Mode or Manner of that Performance; and for their Souls being <hi>Tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte,</hi> I paſs it for an <hi>Aenigma</hi> or Riddle, conceiving there is no apparent Senſe in that Expreſſion, nor any clear Truth to be drawn out of it.</p>
               <p>P. 34. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That his, the Soul, can look upon one thing, and think upon another of a quite different nature; and that ſhe can be in the noiſe of an Army, and yet in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and bleſſed Peace: She can cool the Blood in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fervour of Luſt.</hi> P. 35. <hi>So that it is evident, ſhe hath an abſolute Empire over the Body, and all its Parts, and is not conſtrain'd in her Motions by them, but they are all at her Command, and move by her Direction.</hi> Hereunto I Reply, That ſo much as is true, of what he ſays the Soul can do, may be moſt properly predicated of the Man, and not of the Soul, which alone, can do no ſuch things as he ſpeaks of. Next, for the abſolute Monarchical Power, which he aſcribes to the Soul over the Perſon, I think he is in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour about it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>That which I do, I allow not; for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>And that it is not I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>To will, is preſent with me, but how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which is good, I find not; for the good I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do; and it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me. I delight in he Law of God after the inward Man, but I ſee another
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107192:33"/>Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, in my Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> In this Text, St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as I conceive) declares the true State of the Perſon, and ſays, That he [in his Mind, or Rational Faculty,] was convinc'd, that ſuch Actions were good, and that he ought to do them, and therefore had a will to do them, but that at the ſame time there was a Law of Sin in his Members, which withſtood the good Inclination and Will of his Rational Faculty; and againſt the Will and Power of his Rational Faculty, bringeth him into Captivity to the Law of Sin in his Members. If I might Paraphraſe this Text, I would do it thus: Our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was convinc'd in his Underſtanding, that ſuch Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were good, and ought by him to be done; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had a Will to do them, but his Senſual Affections and Luſts, ſtrongly oppoſed the Performance thereof; and had ſuch Power over the Perſon, as to prevail againſt the Dictates of his Reaſon, and the Inclination and Bent of his Will, and bring him under ſuch a Submiſſion to the Law of Sin, as he neither did nor could do that which his Reaſon told him, was his Duty to do; but brought him under ſuch a State of Captivity to the Law of Sin, as to make him do that which in his mind he condemned, and was contrary to his own Underſtanding, the Dictates of his Reaſon, and the Bent of his Will: And the courſe of Proceeding deliver'd by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Text, is undeniably verified by the daily Experience of Men, and with ſo much Advantage on the ſide of our Senſual Affections, that where we find one Man, guided and govern'd by the Dictates of his Rational Mind, we may find perhaps an Hundred, who ſuffer themſelves to be hurried, by the Bent of their Affections and Luſts, into ſuch Actions and Practices, as their own Underſtandings and Reaſons diſapprove, and condemn, and ſometimes ſeek to reſiſt, tho' more often in vain than otherways: So as we may ſay of theſe two Faculties in Man, as Men uſe to do of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107192:33"/>Preſumption and Deſpair; The Reaſonable Faculty of Man governs its Thouſands, and the Senſual Affections their Ten Thouſands: And I think it is made appear by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Power of Reaſon in Man, is neither Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, nor Monarchical, but rather is a Power Co-ordinate with that of the Affections and Paſſions, and generally ſo unſucceſsful in its Conteſts with them for Government, that where one Man is truly govern'd by the Dictates of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, perhaps an hundred are hurried and let away, by the Attempts and over-ruling Power of their Affections and Paſſions, againſt the clear Dictates, and often againſt the Will, or Rational Deſire of the Perſon. And I think this Proves what hath before been ſaid, that the Regiment of Reaſon in Man, is not Monarchical, but Co-ordinate, and Swaſive only. It is able to Perſwade powerfully, but not to Compel Obedience to its Directions; and therefore I conceive Mr. <hi>W.</hi> was miſtaken, when he ſaid, <hi>That the Power or Regiment of Reaſon in Man, was both Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical and Abſolute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 35. He diſcourſes much concerning the Nature and Eſſence of a Spirit, and the Life of it; amongſt which, there are Sayings which I do not well underſtand: Nor doth all his Diſcourſe make me underſtand what is the Nature of a Spirit, a thing which I am apt to conſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not know; and becauſe I think it gives little light, in our preſent Queſtion, it ſhall here be paſs'd over.</p>
               <p>P. 36. He pretends here, <hi>That the Soul hath Life in her ſelf, as a Spirit;</hi> before he hath proved to my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there is ſuch a Soul in Man, I think it needs no proving, that a thing which is not, neither hath, nor can have Accidents, Adjuncts, or Attributes; and the Being of his ſort of Soul, which is neither granted nor proved, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived to have Life in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays Thirdly, <hi>That a Spirit hath a Power of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, or gliding, through the hard ſolid Bodies of Marble,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107192:34"/>or Iron, without finding, or making any Cleft, Chink, or Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny therein.</hi> I doubt he delivers in theſe Words, that which he doth not know to be true, or is otherways able to prove. He delivers other things in this Place concerning Spirits, which I think other Men are not reſolved of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 37. He ſays, <hi>The Jews could not keep</hi> Peter, <hi>in ſuch a Priſon, as the Angel which deliver'd him could not penetrate:</hi> Whereas the Text doth not declare, whether the Angel came into the Priſon through the Walls, or by opening the Doors; but I count it certain, that the Doors were opened for <hi>Peter</hi> to go out, and therefore likely might ſo be, at the coming in of the Angel alſo; and as the Iron-Gate was that led them into the City. He adds; <hi>The Soul of a Man is truly a Spirit, as an Angel is:</hi> How truly, is now in Diſpute. He ſays, <hi>The Soul manifeſts her Preſence more eminently in the Brain, than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Body.</hi> And I Anſwer, That the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Faculty, is not only more eminently in the Head and Brain, than in any other Part of the Body, but that it reſides and acts in the Head only, without being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to any other Part of the Body; becauſe all the Organs of Underſtanding and Reaſon, are by God the Creator, placed only in the Head, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Member having a ſhare therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 38. He raiſes a Diſpute, Whether Light be a Body; and compares it to the Penetration of a Spirit: But I paſs it over, as little pertinent to our preſent Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> further ſays, <hi>That a Spirit, and his ſort of Soul, is indiviſible, or indiſcerptible, not ſubject to Blows or Wounds, nor to be conſumed by the fierceſt fire.</hi> I think he ſhould here have expreſs'd, how it can be tormented by fire; and yet have no Parts or Particles of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the fervent Heat, or by the violent Pain and Torment which it ſuffers.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:107192:34"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 39. He quotes St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s <hi>Are not able to kill the Soul;</hi> which is indeed the ſtrongeſt Refuge of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, referred here by me to a future Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 40. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>His ſort of Soul muſt either be God, or a Creature.</hi> And thereupon I am apt to deny that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other; and to pretend [as I have often before done] that there is no ſuch thing, or ſort of Being in the World; and therefore cannot be endued, either with Senſe or Reaſon, as (by ſaying) he would perſwade us it is. He ſays, <hi>That the Soul is the proper and immediate Seat of Senſe:</hi> And I Reply (as I have often before) It is not the Soul, but the Perſon that is ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 41. He ſays, <hi>The Soul is endued with Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> I ſay that it is not the Soul alone, but the Man that is ſo. He ſays, <hi>Reaſon is the moſt Noble Faculty of the Humane Nature, by means of which, we [Men] know God, and hold a Communion with Him, and do divers other great things here named.</hi> And in theſe Sayings I am at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with him, without believing theſe things are done by the Soul alone, but by the Perſon <hi>in Compoſito,</hi> chiefly acted therein by the Faculty and Power of its Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Here he quotes an Author, that ſays, <hi>Homo ſolus est ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, corpus autem hominis, opus &amp; inſtrumentum; &amp; animus intelligentiam exercet, ſine ullo corporis inſtrumento.</hi> In En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh thus: <hi>The Soul only is the Man, and the Body is but the Souls Organ, or Inſtrument; and the Soul can exerciſe its Faculty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, without any Aſſiſtance of the Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Organs.</hi> But this Quotation proves no more to me, than that there are other Men who are of Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, and think as he doth, which there was no need at all to prove, becauſe I ſtand convinc'd, that the World of Men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are ſo: But let Mr. <hi>W.</hi> prove, that thoſe Words of his Author are true, and then, <hi>Erit mihi magnus Apollo;</hi> I will give up the Cudgels to him, and confeſs him Victorious in this Diſpute: For I am agreed with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107192:35"/>of his Book, <hi>de Anima, That if the Soul ever was known to do, or can be proved able to do any thing, without aſſiſtance of the Body and its Organs, ſuch Proof will be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence enough, to Convince conſidering Perſons, that ſhe hath a Nature, and Subſiſtence of her own, wherein ſhe can act in a ſtate of Seperation from the Body.</hi> But of this Power I find no more Proof, but the Saying recited in this Quotation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 42. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>If the Soul will, the Feet walk, the Hands work; and ſo for the Motion of the Eyes, and other like things.</hi> All which I paſs (as before) for a Miſtake, mendable by ſaying, If the Man will, the Feet walk, and the Hands work, and the like. Further, in his <hi>Fifthly,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The Soul is Vitally united with the Body, and by virtue of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, enlivens and acts it.</hi> Thereunto I ſay, That the Spirit of Life in Man, or the Body, make but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; who, whilſt he lives, moves, directs, and acts himſelf, and uſes his Intellective, Voluntary, and Memorative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Faculties, with full Liberty, according to his own liking and pleaſure, naturally. He ſpeaks here of a Vital Union between the Body and the Soul; which Expreſſion I do not Approve; becauſe they both together make but one Perſon; as two Ingredients, which make but one <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum;</hi> not as two different things that are united, and joyned together, but as Ingredients may be totally mixed; and a new Product ariſe out of them all; ſo as that if any of them be wanting in the Compoſition; the Product can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truly be the ſame it was before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 43. He ſays, <hi>That to tell you what the Soul is, ſo as to make it an Intelligible Notion, is not ſo impoſſible a thing as ſome have conceiv'd it to be.</hi> Thereto I ſay, that by ſuch Deſcriptions, as he hath before made of the Soul, and all that he hath hitherto ſpoken thereof, I am not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, or believe any more coneerning his ſort of Soul, than I did before I began to peruſe his Treatiſe. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of thoſe things, which he ſaith he hath performed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107192:35"/>I paſs over, as finding no Proving Force among them. I find no more Chapters in this Treatiſe, than thoſe Four which have before been Examined; but that here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> begins to alter his Method, and to divide the reſt of his Treatiſe, by Arguments, to the Number of <hi>Eighteen,</hi> of which he Treats diſtinctly, and ſeverally, in his following Diſcourſe; and I purpoſe to follow him therein, and uſe the ſame Method in my Obſervations.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PAge</hi> 44. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Says, <hi>That upon Gods breathing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Adam, He is in the Text called a Liveng Soul; a Denomination taken from the more excellent Part of Man, his Soul.</hi> This Expreſſion ſeems to Agree with what I have formerly ſpoken, That here the Words, a Living Soul, ſignifie and intend a Living Perſon; putting the more noble Part or Ingredient, to ſignifie the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo as it paſſes in his Judgment, for a Figurative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 46. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Says, <hi>When God Breathed (which he properly doth not) there is ſomething elſe meant, which can be nothing elſe but a ſpecial Act of Creation; by which he made the Spirit or Breath of Life, which he breathed into Man.</hi> I Anſwer, That in the Text there is no expreſs mention of a Creation, either of Breath or Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 47. He Says, <hi>By the Breath of God, is meant that Act of Divine Power, by which God made Man, and gave Life to him.</hi> I am not willing to differ from Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and therefore agree to this Expreſſion. He quotes, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 33.6. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth.</hi> The later of them alluding to God's Power, ſhewed in the Creation of <hi>Adam;</hi> but thence he infers, This Breathing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107192:36"/>into <hi>Adam,</hi> muſt be look'd upon as the Creating ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what: But I find no ſtrength at all in this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; nor that it proves with any ſtrength of Coherſion, the Creation of any thing, ſave <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body, at the time when God made Man: And I grant that then, whatſoever was Created beſides his Body, was a Creature. But I do not herein find any manner of Proof, that God then Created a Soul for <hi>Adam.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Repeats his former Argument concerning the ſignification of the Hebrew Word, which our Tranſlators have rendred by the Term of <hi>Breath,</hi> and ſays, <hi>That the ſame Word doth alſo ſometimes ſignifie Spirit.</hi> To this I ſay, That our Tranſlators thought it not fit to render it by the Term of <hi>Spirit</hi> in this place; and I value their Judgment before thoſe of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> or Mr. <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> and therefore take that Word to ſignifie moſt properly in this place, the Breath of Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 48. He pretends the words ſhould run thus, <hi>God breathed or created in Man the Breath of Life, or that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Soul of Life.</hi> And in truth, if the words had run ſo, they would have run much better for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Opinion, than now they do; but I do not perceive by what Authority he takes upon him ſo to Correct or (as ſome may take it) Corrupt the Text. <hi>The Breathing,</hi> which he ſays, <hi>diſcover'd a New Created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be there;</hi> I ſay, detected only a Spirit of Life to be there: which was tinded and kindled in the Spirits of the Blood and Humours, then fitted and ready for that Operation, by the moderate fanning of that Breath, which God, or his Agents, then breathed into <hi>Adam</hi>'s Noſtrils; and this was the humane Spirit of Life, tinded and kindled by that Breath of Life; and from that time to this time it is, and muſt be, continually kept Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Glowing by the conſtant reſpirations and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Breath; by want of which this Flame would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107192:36"/>be Extinguiſhed in a ſhort time, or a very few moments of it.</p>
                  <p>He quotes again, <hi>Annotations of the Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> in the Rump-Parliament time, for his purpoſe, without telling us what they ſay upon it; and for want of their Annotations, I know not what they ſay of it: And if I did, I ſhould not be much moved by their Authority, except they give better Reaſons for their Opinion, than Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath yet done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 49. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Arguing, ſays, <hi>The Soul of Man, or the Spirit, or the Breath of Life in Man, Liveth in and with the Body, and yet Dieth not with the Body: And this,</hi> he ſays, <hi>needs Proof:</hi> And ſo do I ſay too: And he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to prove it, by ſaying, <hi>That whoſe Life dependeth not on the Body, muſt not Die when the Body Dieth; but the Souls Life depends not on the Body: Therefore it muſt needs not Die when the Body Dieth:</hi> And the Reaſon why he ſays the Souls Life depends not upon the Body, is, becauſe God made it a Spirit of Life, to give Life to the Body, and not to receive any Life from it.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, If this Arguing be not that which Men call <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> or begging the Queſtion, I know not what is.</p>
                  <p>We are now diſputing, Whether <hi>Adam</hi> had an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Soul Created for him at firſt, or not; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a Soul have a Seperate Subſiſtence after the Death of the Perſon: And in both theſe Points he maintains the Affirmative, and pretends to prove the Seperate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence by its being a Created Intelligent Spirit, made by God for <hi>Adam,</hi> at the firſt: And thus proves one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Point by another, as highly Controverted as it ſelf; and which I conceive, his offers in this Argument, do very weakly and inſufficiently prove.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 50. He obſerves out of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text, That it ſays nothing of the Body's Life, before God breathed into him a Spirit or Soul of Life (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will have it) tho' the words of our Bible expreſly call it, <hi>The Breath of Life:</hi> And I ſo far agree, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body had not Life, till this Breath of Life [or this Breath cauſing Life, was breathed into it; but that from thence he began to Live and became a Living Perſon.] Thus far we are at Agreement: His next two or three Pages are ſpent in Proof of the Souls Immortality, drawn from the two before-mentioned Topicks, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul is an Intelligent Spirit, and was newly Created by God for <hi>Adam;</hi> and next, that it is ſuch a Spirit as can ſubſiſt in a State of Seperation from the Body: And thereupon, I ſay, That if he, or any that is of his Opinion, can convince with ſome clearneſs, That God Created ſuch an Intelligent Soul for <hi>Adam,</hi> as can Subſiſt, Act, and Suffer, in a State of Seperation from the Body; he ſhall need to make no further Proof to me of the Souls Immortality; becauſe, if the former be true, I have no Inclination or Intention to diſpute the later: And therefore I paſs over what he ſays to that purpoſe, and ſhut up my Obſervations upon this Argument with the fore-mentioned Concluſion, That Mr. <hi>W.</hi>'s Arguments therein produced, to prove the Creation of an intelligent Soul or Spirit for <hi>Adam,</hi> at the firſt, are infirm, invalid, and little convicning to ſuch underſtanding as I have been able to imploy in the peruſal of them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PAge</hi> 54. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes, The Hiſtory of <hi>Saul</hi>'s going to the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> Relating the words ſpoken to her by him. <hi>I pray thee divine to me by the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Spirit, and bring me him up, whom I ſhall name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee:</hi> And ſhe deſiring to know who that <hi>Him</hi> was,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107192:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>which ſhe ſhould bring up, <hi>Saul</hi> told her it was <hi>Samuel;</hi> Upon this Text, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> thus Comments, That <hi>Saul</hi> by this demand muſt need intend the bringing up of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Soul to Diſcourſe with him; and from thence Collects, That the <hi>Jews</hi> of that Age held the ſame Opinion which he now maintains, concerning the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence after the Death of the Perſon. To which I Reply, That this Collection ſeems in a great part to ariſe from his own Inclination to have it ſo, and his Imagination thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing that it is ſo; for if I were imploy'd to Collect from this Hiſtory, I ſhould conceive, That <hi>Saul</hi>'s Head was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways imployed at that time, than to conſider what that was which he deſired to be brought up, whether it ſhould be a Spirit, a Body, or a Perſon, or an Appear-Dance only, and not a real Being: I conceive his Head was not troubled about ſuch Speculations; but his whole Deſign was by the Witches means to get knowledge what the ſucceſs of his Affairs ſhould be in a time when he was greatly diſtreſſed. It ſeems to have been the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of divers Ages, to fore-tell Actions paſt, and future Succeſſes, by raiſing up and conſulting with the Dead; and from this Practice they had (amongſt other Titles) the Name of Necromancer beſtowed upon them. This Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Magicians</hi> and <hi>Witches,</hi> hath been long taken notice of in the World; and it ſeems by <hi>Saul</hi>'s Demand made to the Woman, he had heard, or otherwiſe knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof, and deſired by the Witches means thus to conſult the Dead, and particularly <hi>Samuel,</hi> as the moſt knowing amongſt them; and from ſuch a Collection, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it doth not appear what <hi>Saul</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> of his time, thought concerning the Seperate Subſiſtence of Souls. We meet with divers Relations of Appearances made and contrived by the Art of Magicians of later times, but never yet heard of raiſing an Argument from thence, to prove the Eſtate or Condition of departed Souls;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107192:38"/>nor do I conceive this Argument hath any ſtrength in it to that purpoſe; and therefore I paſs over Mr. <hi>W.</hi>'s o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expreſſions uſed in this Argument, with this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obſervation; that he raiſed the Argument out of this Hiſtory, with intent to reach as high a time as was poſſible for producing any ſort of Evidence, or raiſing any manner of Argument, which might be brought or drawn to touch the Seperate Subſiſtence of Souls; and this, as the higheſt pitch of time that he could reach, he choſe to make uſe of for that purpoſe; fulfilling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Old Proyerb, <hi>Willing Perſons will rather play a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>PAge</hi> 57. He ſays, <hi>He is ſtruck with wonder to hear Men aſſert, That the Soul and Body of a Man Die to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and are both Buried in one Grave.</hi> My Opinion is ſomewhat otherwiſe worded; expreſſing I think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that when Reſpiration fails, and the Perſon dies, the Flame of Life is Extinguiſhed, which doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a being Buried, or a Going any whither; not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe to agree with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Expreſſion of going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or downward; and if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> doth really wonder at this conception, I make no Argument of it, and ſhall only thereunto Anſwer I cannot help it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 58. <hi>The Soul or Breath of Man was Breathed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Adam by an act of Creation.</hi> This I have all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, and continue to do ſo; becauſe I think Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath hereto failed in the Proof of it: He hopes his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will not be ſuch Blaſphemers as to deny the truth of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Words, <hi>The Spirit returns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to God who gave it.</hi> Concerning which Words, I have before fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my Conceptions, and have no deſign to repeat them again here. Further he quotes again, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. as if <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> there ſaid, That when Man dieth, his Body goes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107192:38"/>one way, and his Spirit another; and whether he quotes this Text truly, ſhall be left to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> puts an Objection againſt himſelf: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſome may ſay, If all Souls return to God that gave them, the Souls of the Wicked do ſo too; and he grants that ſo they do; and for ſolution of this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he ſays. That tho' God be in his higheſt Heavens, and keep his Seſſions there; yet there are ſome other parts of the Heaven, where he keeps a particular Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to which Evil Spirits may approach, as they did in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi>'s Viſion, where God may paſs Sentence upon the Souls of the Wicked, without bringing them into Heaven; and he thinks God hath a glorious Preſence in the lower Heavens with his Angels, and that there he doth Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act many Affairs relating to the Government of this World; and quotes for this the Devils Appearance in the Caſe of <hi>Job;</hi> and ſays, <hi>If Devils may appear before God, ſo may the Souls of the Wicked do too.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwering, I declare to agree with his laſt Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, That if there be Seperate Souls of Wicked Men, Subſiſting by themſelves, they may appear before God, as his quoted Texts teſtifie Devils have done; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as clear Texts and Teſtimonies of Scripture, for the appearing of wicked Souls before God, as are quoted for the appearing of Devils before him: But he brings not one Text, to Prove that he ſaith Truth, concerning the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of wicked Souls before God. And I confide, that no one Text of Scripture can be brought, which gives an Aſſertory Teſtimony of that Fact; or ſays there was ever ſuch a thing done in the World: And for what he ſays of God's keeping his Seſſions of Judgment, ſometimes in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſometimes in other particular Parts of Heaven, I am apt to demand Proofs thereof, from Texts of Scripture, but he brings not one to this purpoſe: And therefore I think it may be concluded, that theſe ſeveral Seſſions of God for Judgment, are but a Device of his own Brain,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107192:39"/>which hath no real Truth in it. And thus, by Mens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, they ſtrive to heal, cover, and confirm their Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions, which I look upon as a great Fault in a good Man: But notwithſtanding thoſe Humane Inventions, I am apt to conclude, that if the good Souls go to God for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Heaven, that bad Souls do alſo (ſomewhat evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently) do the like. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>The Soul returns to God who gave it. The Soul returns,</hi> are Words that intend indefinitely, and ſeem therefore equivalent to an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and ſignifie as much as if it had been ſaid, All Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God who gave them: And this Senſe of the Words, our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Author hath lately granted, Whence I conclude, that as God ſays, <hi>All Souls are mine</hi> [which I think intends Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons]; ſo all Souls are intended to return to God who gave them, as well and as much the Bad as the Good, for any thing that I can perceive, either in the words of the Text, or any thing [that is true] in our Author's Diſcourſe of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 60. He puts a Second Objection againſt this Opinion, which, I think, he doth ſet up as a <hi>Man of Straw,</hi> that he may have the battering of it down again. He pretends, ſome ſay, that he hath indeed proved, the Soul and Body to be ſeperated at Death; and that one of them goes to one Place, and the other of them goes to the other Place; but that he hath not yet proved the Soul to live in that State of Seperation. Hereupon I obſerve, That after he hath ſaid, <hi>The Soul and Body are ſeperated at Death,</hi> he adds, <hi>That they go to two different Places.</hi> Which Saying, I think, the Text doth not warrant; for it doth not ſay, that either of them go to any Place: And firſt, we may be ſure a dead Body cannot go any whither. The Text ſays, <hi>It returns to the Earth as it was;</hi> and of which before it received Life, <hi>it</hi> was a Part: So for the Spirit, the Text ſays, <hi>It returns</hi> [not goes] <hi>to God who gave it.</hi> I have before offer'd an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, That <hi>Solomon</hi> might intend, this Spirit return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, in a natural and eaſie manner, as a Part doth to its <hi>Totum;</hi> and the Parcels of Air, or Water, return to and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107192:39"/>incorporate with their Elements; and that as the Body returns to the Earth, as it was, and as a Part doth to its <hi>Totum;</hi> ſo the Spirit returns to God from whom it came, and of which I ſuppoſe <hi>Solomon</hi> might think it to have been a Part: But I grant, That if the Soul, in our Author's Senſe, do go to God after Death, then the Objection which ſays he did not prove it alive, in a ſeperate State, is vain and frivolous, and may eaſily be overthrown, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Author to the Trouble of Defending his Opinion againſt it. In the Cloſe of this Argument, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> asks, <hi>What hath the Living God to do with dead Spirits?</hi> And I ſay ſo too; and therefore grant, that if the Intelligent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Spirit of a Man be dead, it can with no Propriety or Truth, be ſaid to <hi>Return to God who gave it.</hi>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 61. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>So I ſhut up this Third Argument, and with it, my Proofs from the Old Teſtament.</hi> And concerning theſe Threee Arguments, I ſay, the Firſt is meaſurably Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed; the Second is Diſregarded, and the Third is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Expounded; and in ſuch a manner, as Oppoſes Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Pretenſions thereupon.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth Argument.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PAg.</hi> 61. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes here that Text of Scripture, whereby the Opinion of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence is principally ſupported; and upon which, it is with a great meaſure of Clearneſs, grounded; and which ariſes near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Aſſertion that the thing is ſo; and I think Mr. <hi>W.</hi> doth from thence rightly Argue, That if the Soul cannot be killed, by killing the Body or Perſon, it ſeems to be a reaſonable Inference, drawn from this Text, to Argue, That the Soul muſt needs have a Seperate Subſiſtence of its own, after the Death of the Perſon. And further Mr. <hi>W.</hi> obſerves well the Reaſon, why our Lord deliver'd this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to his Diſciples, <hi>viz.</hi> To encourage them againſt the Fears of ſuch Perſecutions as were likely to fall upon them in the Proſecution of their great Duty, the Preaching of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107192:40"/>the Goſpel; encouraging them not to ſear, what Harm Men could do unto them, upon that account; becauſe <hi>Men could only kill the Body,</hi> [intending the Perſon] <hi>but were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to kill the Soul,</hi> [or lay any other ſort of real Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Men, after their departure out of this world.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 62. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> produces an Argument, which I think he rightly terms <hi>an Abſurd One;</hi> for he pretends there are ſome that ſay, <hi>That the Soul may die when the Body dieth, though it be not ſlain when the Body is killed.</hi> To this I ſay, I am none of thoſe who ſo Argue, nor did I ever yet meet with a Writing, or Perſon, that did ſo. Next he produces ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection, of ſome, who he ſuppoſes may ſay, <hi>That the killing of the Soul here, may intend, that they cannot kill it for ever.</hi> All I can ſay to this, is, That if any Man, or Men, have ſo Argued, they are not at all of my mind, who do not intend to make, or offer any ſuch Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 63. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſets down an Objection offer'd againſt the Text of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the Words, <hi>Are not able to kill the Soul;</hi> from <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the Body, and after that, have no more that they can do.</hi> He ſays, He hath kown ſome very confidently affirm, that there is no Force in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text, becauſe that of St. <hi>Luke</hi> delivers the ſame Doctrine of our Lord, in Words, from which no clear Argument can be deduced, for the Soul's Seperate Subſiſtence: I ſay, I do not Affirm in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no proving Force in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text; becauſe St. <hi>Luke</hi> differs from him, in relating the Words of our Lord's Doctrine; But yet I own my ſelf to think, that from the manner of Wording this Doctrine of our Lord, in theſe two Texts, a ſtrong Objection may be rais'd againſt the abſolute Authority of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s words in this Point. Upon the Conſideration, and comparing theſe two Texts, one with the other, the only Variance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, is in the Words of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s <hi>Are not able to kill the Soul,</hi> compared with thoſe of St. <hi>Luke, Have no more that they can do;</hi> for that in the following Words,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107192:40"/>where <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, <hi>Fear him who is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell;</hi> and thoſe which <hi>Luke</hi> mentions, <hi>Fear him, who after he hath killed; hath power to eaſt into Hell.</hi> I conceive the Difference to be ſmall, or none at all: They both begin our Lord's Doctrine in the ſame Words, <hi>Fear not them that kill the Body;</hi> where they both ſpeak fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively: And I therefore believe our Lord himſelf did ſo; but I ſay the Body in this place, muſt needs intend the Perſon, or the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Soul and Body together; for that our Senſe and Reaſon ſufficiently aſſures us, That what is dead, cannot be killed; but the Body without the Soul, or Spirit of Life, is dead. And therefore the Body taken ſingly, or not acted by the Spirit of Life, is a dead Body, and therefore cannot be killed. Whence I infer, that when our Evangeliſts ſpeak of killing the Body, they muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly intend the ſame, as if they had ſaid, Cannot kill the Perſon. And hence I Collect, That when St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks of caſting the Soul and Body into Hell; he intends, caſting the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of them both, or the Perſon, into Hell. St. <hi>Luke</hi> words it thus, <hi>Who after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell.</hi> I think this intends as much as if he had ſaid, Hath Power to caſt the Perſon into Hell; ſo as it ſeems, the Senſe of both our Evangeliſts is the ſame, both in the Premiſes, and in the Concluſion of this Doctrine; and the Variance between them, lies as before hath been ſaid, in the Words, <hi>Are not able to kill the Soul,</hi> of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew;</hi> and the Words, <hi>Have no more that they can do;</hi> of St. <hi>Luke.</hi> If we ſhall conſider the proper Intent of both theſe Texts, we muſt find it to be as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of our Lord's Diſciples, not to fear the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, for the doing of their Duty; but rather to fear God, who can puniſh and reward after Death, as well as in this Life: And the Texts of both our Evangeliſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree punctually to that Intent, in delivering Words of the ſame Importance, and to the ſame Intent and Purpoſe. But
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107192:41"/>then, if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> or any other Perſon, will draw out of them Proofs of any other Collateral thing, which is not properly within the Intent of our Lord's Doctrine, I conceive they ſpeak, and may intend differently, concerning that Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Point, which Men may deſign to prove by them. It ſeems ſomewhat clear to my Underſtanding, St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Words prove his Opinion to be, That Humane Souls have a Life and Subſiſtence in a ſtate of Seperation from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and I conceive, that in his Text, he worded our Lord's Doctrine, according to his own Opinion of the thing. We find that St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath worded it in a different and varient manner, ſo expreſſing our Lord's Doctrine, as that he gives no ground for proving the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence from his Text, which in the whole Tenour of it, doth not name the Soul: And therefore, upon this difference, I think it needful to enquire, or demand, What were the very preciſe Words, wherein our Lord deliver'd this Doctrine? If St. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath rightly worded this Doctrine, then it is a ſtrong Proof of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence: The moſt ſubſtantial and neareſt to an Affirmative, of any that the Bible affords us; but if St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath rightly worded our Lord's Doctrine, then was there in that Doctrine, no Proof at all of a Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, nor any thing ſaid in it, whereby that Opinion can be maintain'd. I do not pretend to determine any thing concerning this Point, but am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Argue, that there lies a Probability for St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Text, againſt that of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Point in Queſtion, concerning the Seperate Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, is (as was ſaid) collateral to the Intent of our Lord in this Doctrine, who it ſeems, did not here mean to teach any thing, which might direct Mens Judgments in that Collateral Point, which remains utterly unmentioned in the Text of St. <hi>Luke.</hi> This moves me to apprehend, That the putting it into St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text, grew from his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the thing, rather than from the Words which our
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107192:41"/>Lord then delivered. The intent of our Lord, ſeems plain in both thoſe Texs; and therein what hath been ſaid ſeems true, they are at a perfect Agreement between themſelves; and we find no intention of meaning in our Lord to ſpeak or teach any thing about the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence; and therefore I ſurmiſe it came into St. <hi>Mathew</hi>'s Text, by Accident, and Sprung rather from his own Opinion, than from our Lords Doctrine, or the Words and Expreſſions thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, That St. <hi>Matthew</hi> was by Profeſſion and Practice a Publican; a Trade which no Man of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Learning amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of that time, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to Practice; whence <hi>Matthew</hi> might more eaſily fall into the Opinion, appearing in his Text. <hi>That Souls did Live and Subſiſt after the Departure and Death of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> But of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> we read, That he was a Learned Man, and a Phyſician; and <hi>Paul,</hi> (from whoſe Mouth he is ſaid to have Written) was the moſt Learned amongſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and of a Sublime, Natural, Genius: But there appears no likelihood that they were of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in this matter of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence; which if our Lord had mentioned in this Doctrine, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they would not have failed to take great notice of it, becauſe it was a Subject of high Speculation, not fit to be let fall to the Ground without notice, and delivering of the ſame to the Chriſtians of that time: If our Lord's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (worded as it is by St. <hi>Matthew</hi>) were truly the ſame as that Evangeliſt hath reported it: And upon theſe grounds, I am apt to conceive, that St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Words, <hi>Are not able to kill the Soul;</hi> are likely to have ſprung from his own Opinion of the thing, and are not otherways the very true Expreſſions and Words, wherein our Lord delivered this Doctrine to his Diſciples: And therefore I am apt to Appeal from the Text of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> to that which is reported to us in the Text of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:107192:42"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, I conceive that the Text of St. <hi>Luke</hi> (word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at it is) doth more fully expreſs our Lords meaning, as in this Doctrine, than the Text of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s doth For <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, That after Men have Killed, they have no more that they can do, or can do no more harm to the Killed Perſon, or can Bring no more Sufferings upon him by any thing that they can do. I think St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Words <hi>(Are not able to kill the Soul)</hi> do not ſo well or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs our Lords meaning, as St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s do: For that thoſe who maintain the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, do ſay all, that it retains the Faculties of Intellect, and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the Natural Powers thereunto properly belonging. Whence it ſeems Inferrible, that they may, and do, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſuch Relations, and Friends, as they left behind them on Earth; and are likely to be ſo much concerned for them, as to rejoyce at their Well-fare, and be grieved at their Sufferings: For of this, we are informed from the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> (if it have a Power of Proving or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch caſes) for <hi>Dives</hi> tho' Wicked and in Torments, yet had ſo much good Nature in him as to remember his Relations upon Earth, and have care to prevent thoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which they was otherwiſe likely to fall under; and prays <hi>Lazarus</hi> may be ſent out, to obviate by his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Calamity which was like to befal them, and make ſome Addition to thoſe Sufferings, under which himſelf now lay; and from hence we may Collect, that Men who have Killed, can ſtill make ſome Additions to the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Dead, by Tormenting or perſecuting their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or Friends upon Earth; which poſſibility is quite taken away by the Words of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Text, After Killing the Perſon, Men have no more that they can do; they can do no more harm to the Dead Perſon, who is now gone quite out of the reach of any but God; and I doubting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive, there is neither Soul nor Body left of him, for Men or Devils to prey upon. And from what is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107192:42"/>I am ready to conceive, That St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Words do more fully and properly expreſs our Lord's meaning, than thoſe of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> do; and conſequently that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable our Lords Doctrine was deliver'd in the Words of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel, rather than in thoſe Words which St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> hath Recorded; and if this prove a truth, it will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly remove the proving force of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Text; which is otherways the Principal Foundation, upon which the Opinion of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence is Built. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I do not doubtingly, but fully conceive, That Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his partakers, will openly exclaim againſt my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, in offering, or pretending to prove or conceive that any ſort of Scripture Words, or Expreſſions, can be Erroneous; and yet it ſeems both clear and common, that Words, Sayings, and Texts of Scripture, have been often, and are Daily brought, and alledged for the Proof of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Opinions and Doctrines. I confeſs my ſelf not ſo much to Idolize the Words and Expreſſions of Scripture, as to receive for an Oracle, every Saying or Sentence which I find Written in the Bible: or to believe every ſuch Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Sentence, to be an irrefragable truth, and the very Word of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</hi> I conceive there is no other way to try Mens Pretences to the Spirit of God, but either by the miraculous Works of ſuch Perſons as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, or by the Fruits of the Spirit, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in their Works and Actions amongſt Men; and the Tryals by either of theſe means proceed upon grounds of Humane Underſtanding; and the reſults thereof as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and Paraphraſe to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Text: I conceive it may be ſaid, Believe not every Saying and Sentence which ye find Written in Scripture: But try firſt whether that Saying or Sentence be the Word of God, or no. And in this Tryal it ſeems there are but two ways or means to be uſed. The firſt is, by comparing it by other Scriptures,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107192:43"/>or Texts, or the Analogy, Current, or Stream of Doctrine, which runs and continues through the whole Scriptures, from the Beginning to the End thereof: And if any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sentence oppoſe the Analogy, or Stream of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which runs through the whole Scriptures; Men may reſt aſſured, that Saying, or Sentence, neither is nor can be the Word of God. Next if we meet with Sayings or Sentences of Scripture, which are oppoſed by other Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or Sentences thereof; it ſeems we may have good Reaſon to doubt on which ſide the truth ſtands, and by the moſt fair and eaſie Conſtructions that we can uſe, bring them to ſuch an Agreement as by workings of Reaſon they can be brought unto. And I am apt to infer, That if by Conſtructions of Reaſon, they cannot be made ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſuch manner as both them may be true, I think it a reaſonable Reſult of ſuch Tryal, to think (as it muſt needs be) that there is Error or Miſtake in one of them. The other means for trying the Truths of the Scripture Sayings, or Sentences, proceeds from the grounds of Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>viz.</hi> The common Senſations and Reaſons of Men, radicated in their Natures, and confirmed unto them by certain and often Experiences.</p>
                  <p>And it ſeems, that if Men meet with ſuch Sayings, or Sentences in Scripture, as are oppoſite to Natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the common Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them by Practice, and Experience, we may with aſſurance enough conclude, that ſuch Sayings, or Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ought not to paſs among us for the Word of God. And yet I am apt to believe, that my Opinion in this Point, will not find an eaſie acceptance, amongſt thoſe who practice the Reading and Magnifying of the Scriptures, which is alſo without doubt, a very Beneficial and Laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Practice: And yet I think I may juſtly apply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the common Proverb of <hi>Omne nimium vertitur in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</hi> Upon the ſuppoſal that Men will be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107192:43"/>and abundance of them to contradict what I have ſaid before, in reference to the Sayings and Sentences of the Scripture. I undergo the Pains of annexing to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, Diverſe Inſtances Collected out of the Scriptures; which I think will evince, that there are Texts of Scripture, whoſe common and ordinary Senſe and Intendment, ſeems ſo different and oppoſite one to another; as that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Underſtandings of Men, of good Intellect and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot make them ſtand together ſo well, as that they may both be true; and I will go no further for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch a Collection than to the Goſpel of St <hi>Matthew</hi> only, beginning the ſame with Chap. 21. where the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt Relates, That our Lord ſent two of his Diſciples, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them to go to the Village over againſt them; where he ſaid they ſhould find an Aſs, and a Colt tyed, and directs, looſe them and bring them tome, <hi>And the Diſciples went and did as Jeſus commanded them, and brought the Aſs, and the Colt, and put on them their Cloaths, and they ſet him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And then reports the Triumphant manner of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſo Mounted.</p>
                  <p>I conceive the Words of this Text, do with ſome clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs import, That our Lord was ſet upon both theſe Beaſts at the ſame time, and ſo Triumphantly entered into <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> and obſerving thereupon, I am ready to queſtion the truth of this Relation, becauſe it thwarts the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice, and even the common Senſe of Mankind, and ſeems ſuch an extravagant ſort of Riding, as that common Reaſon oppoſes the credibility of it: And ſo do the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels of the other three Evangeliſts; they all mention our Lords entering into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in ſuch a Triumphant Ovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon an Aſs; and each of them ſay, he Rode upon an Aſs, but none of the other three make mention of any more then one Aſs in the Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſent for an Aſs-Colt, and ſuch a one was brought to him, and he Rode thereupon into <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And from theſe Proofs, I am
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107192:44"/>ready to infer, That what St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, in his Text, of ſending for, finding, and bringing an Aſs and a Colt to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the Diſciples putting upon them their Cloaths, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Jeſus</hi> thereon. All theſe Paſſages ſeem to have a ſtrong Tincture of Fallacy and Error, and that in very truth there was all this while but one Aſs ſent for, and found, and brought, and cover'd, and rid upon. And the Error which I take to be in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Relation, ſeems to be one of the worſt ſort of that kind, not a bare miſtake riſing from Negligence or Ignorance, but Affected and Deſigned by the Writer, who quotes in his Text the Words of the Prophet <hi>Zechariah, Tell ye the Daughter of Zion, behold thy King cometh to thee, meek and ſitting upon an Aſs, and a Colt the fole of an Aſs.</hi> I think it may be with ſome clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Collected, That the deſign of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> was to make Chriſt entering into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> agree in terms with this Prophecy of <hi>Zechariah;</hi> which he thought it could not do, if there were not both an Aſs and a Colt in the Caſe, <hi>John</hi> 12.15. Upon this occaſion quotes the Prophet <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah,</hi> thus, <hi>Fear not Daughter of Zion, behold thy King cometh, ſitting upon an Aſſes-Colt.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> we ſee was not ſo ſcrupulous as to repeat the very Words of the Prophet, but thought them ſufficiently fulfilled, in our Lords Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Ovation into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſitting upon ſuch an Aſs, as was a Colt, the fole of an Aſs. The ſecond Text, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, whoſe verity I intend to queſtion, is read in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. Which comparing with <hi>John</hi> 20. I find them both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Facts done, at the time of our Lords Reſurrection, and Appearing to <hi>Mary Magdalene:</hi> And in the Circumſtances of thoſe Facts, their Relations do ſo much differ one from the other, that I do not find it within the compaſs of my Underſtanding, ſo to reconcile them and make them ſtand together, as that they can both be true; whence I infer a great probability, that there is a miſtaking in one of them; and becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> was preſent at ſome part of the Fact,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107192:44"/>and was likely to have a Relation of the reſt from <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> her ſelf, I think the Report which he makes thereof, is more to be Credited then that of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s; I have compared the Words of them more particularly in a former Treatiſe, and thereupon will refer my Readers to the Chapters themſelves before quoted; out of which an intelligent Reader may eaſily gather the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and difficulties that will ariſe in reconciling of them.</p>
                  <p>A Third Inſtance wherein I queſtion the verity of a Scriptural Expreſſion, ariſes by comparing the Genealogies of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> together; both of them deliver the Genealogy of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Husband of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the reputed Father of our Lord: and both of them agree, that he was Lineally deſcended from King <hi>David:</hi> But <hi>Matthew</hi> brings this Line down by <hi>Solomon</hi> and through the whole Race of the Kings; whereas <hi>Luke</hi> carries his Line down by <hi>Nathan</hi> another Son of <hi>David,</hi> and his Progeny, without mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the Kings in that Deſcent: And thus they differ quite one from another, until they come down to <hi>Salathiel,</hi> who is by <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaid to be the Son of <hi>Jechonias;</hi> and by <hi>Luke</hi> to be the Son of <hi>Neri:</hi> then they both name his Son <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> and from <hi>Zorobabel</hi> downwards their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies differ, as they did before they came to <hi>Salathiel;</hi> reciting Names in their Lines of Deſcent, quite differing the one from the other; and they do not thus only differ in the Names of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Anceſtors, but alſo in the Number of them; for <hi>Matthew</hi> beginning from <hi>David,</hi> and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for one, Names but Twenty ſix. Names of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his Line of Deſcent from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Joſeph;</hi> whereas <hi>Luke</hi> beginning from <hi>David</hi> as one, and deſcending from him down to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> names Forty two Perſons, as Lineal Anceſtors to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſucceeding to one another in the ſpace of Time; ſo as they appear to differ from one another, by the Number of Sixteen Names, or Perſons, ſucceeding one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107192:45"/>another in that compaſs of Time. <hi>Matthew</hi> counting Twenty ſix Names, or Generations; and <hi>Luke</hi> counting Forty two Generations in the ſame Space or Compaſs of Time: And this makes ſuch a Variance between their two Genealogies, as I am not able to reconcile: And therefore I am ready to conceive there is likely ſome miſtake in one of them: And yet further, I find in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Line, That which I think to be another miſtake; for when he comes to King <hi>Joram,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Joram</hi> begat <hi>Ozias;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the Genealogy in <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles, Joram</hi> begat <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and he begat <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and he begat <hi>Amaziah,</hi> all Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> ſucceſſively, and Lineal Deſcendants from <hi>David,</hi> between <hi>Joram</hi> and <hi>Oziah,</hi> and who reigned Kings in <hi>Judah,</hi> for the ſpace of above Seventy Years. Why St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſhould omit the Names of thoſe Kings in his Account, I do not underſtand; and therefore am apt to conceive it was an Error in him. And yet further I find that he counts Fourteen and Fourteen Generations between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and yet upon Examining, the particulars in that Account ſpecified, I find they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount but to Twenty ſix Generations, which ſhews a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> with himſelf; his Senſe in one place differing from that in another; and this alſo I am apt to paſs for a miſtake in him.</p>
                  <p>A Fourth Inſtance in this kind, ariſes from comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. and <hi>Luke</hi> 2. In their Relations of things done ſoon after our Lords birth. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, <hi>That wiſe Men came out of the Eaſt to Worſhip Chriſt, and made their way by Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to Bethlehem</hi> [which was but five Miles diſtance from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>] and tho <hi>Herod</hi> had directed them to return to him, yet they went home again another way: And when they were departed, an Angel directed <hi>Joſeph</hi> to take the Child and his Mother, and flee with them into <hi>Aegypt: And when he aroſe, he took the young Child and his Mother by Night, and departed into Aegypt;</hi> and remained there till
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107192:45"/>an Angel brought him word that <hi>Herod</hi> was dead, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Return into <hi>Judea</hi> again. And this Direction <hi>Joſeph</hi> obeyed, and came thence into <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and to <hi>Nazareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Relation mentions nothing of all this, but ſays, That eight days after the Birth of our Lord, he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed: And when the days of the Virgins Purification were accompliſhed, [his Parents] brought him to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to preſent him to the Lord, and make ſuch an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Moſes</hi> required on that behalf; and when they had performed this, they returned to <hi>Galilee,</hi> to their own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Nazareth.</hi> We read, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.2. <hi>If a Woman have born a Man-Child, ſhe ſhall be unclean ſeven days; and in the eighth day, the Child ſhall be Circumciſed, and the Mother ſhall then continue in the Blood of her Purifying, three and thirty days.</hi> All which days, 7 and 1, and 33, make 41 days, or ſix weeks: And then they went and took <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in their way to <hi>Nazareth.</hi> We celebrate the Wiſe Mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, 12 days after his Birth; and ſoon after their return home, an Angel directed <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Flight into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and then <hi>Herod</hi> finding himſelf mocked by them, ſent forth, and ſlew all the Children that were in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the Coaſts of it. We read in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> That <hi>Herod</hi> continued under a great and languiſhing Diſeaſe, for many Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death; and it ſeems likely, ſome of them paſs'd, after this Infant-Maſſacre, and about a Fortnight of the Virgins Six Weeks Purification, ſeems to have been paſs'd, at, or before this Maſſacre: And I conceive, that the Month which remained of thoſe days, doth not afford time enough for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s going into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> his Abode there, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his Return from thence into <hi>Judea.</hi> I am not able to reſolve my ſelf about this difficulty, but ſhall be glad to receive Inſtruction thereupon, from Men of greater Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Learning, reſting doubtful in the mean time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the very Truth of theſe Relations; the further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107192:46"/>whereof, ſhall be left to the Judgment of my Readers.</p>
                  <p>A Fifth Inſtance in this kind, I take out of the Two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted Chapters of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke. Mat.</hi> begins his Relation of our Lord's Birth, from his Parents being at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> without ſaying from whence, or upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion they came thither: From thence he carries them down into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and brings them up again into <hi>Judea;</hi> but when he heard that <hi>Archilaus</hi> did reign there inſtead of his Father <hi>Herod,</hi> he was afraid to go thither; but being warn'd in a Dream, he turn'd aſide into the Parts of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> and came, and dwelt in a City called <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil an old Prophecy, which ſaid, <hi>He ſhall be called a Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene.</hi> The Words, <hi>They came out of Aegypt, into the Land of Iſrael,</hi> ſeem to intend the Kingdom of <hi>Judea,</hi> where <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilans</hi> reigned, which lay directly in the way between <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> and <hi>Galilee:</hi> And the Words, <hi>He was afraid to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſeem to intend, He was afraid to make his Abode or Settlement there, which made him paſs through that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into the Parts of <hi>Galilee,</hi> then under the Government of another <hi>Herod,</hi> whither he was directed in a Dream to goe; <hi>and he came and dwelt in a City called Nazareth.</hi> It ſeems, as to a ſtrange Place, and before to him unknown.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſeems to make a very different Relation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Particulars; for he ſays our Lord's Parents lived at <hi>Nazareth</hi> before the Conception; and thither the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> came, to make his Annuntiation to the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: After which he ſays, Our Lords Parents went up from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a City of <hi>Galilee,</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to be tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Mary</hi> his eſpouſed Wife, becauſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was of the Lineage of <hi>David.</hi> And that after our Lord's Birth, and the Days of the Purification ended, they went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and preſented the Child before the Lord, and offered ſuch a Sacrifice for him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had commanded; and relates ſome Paſſages then happening, as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107192:46"/>thoſe of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna:</hi> And when they had performed all that was required by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they returned into <hi>Galilee</hi> to their own City <hi>Nazareth.</hi> There ſeems a kind of Repugnancy in theſe Texts, one of them to the other, eſpecially in the Knowledge, which the Parents might have of the City <hi>Nazareth;</hi> for <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as of a place unknown to our Lord's Parents before that time, and ſays, <hi>They went thither by Gods ſpecial dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction delivered to them in a Dream:</hi> Without Notice taking, that they had ever any Knowledge of that Place before; whereas <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, <hi>They dwelt at Nazareth before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and went up from thence to Bethlehem, to be taxed; and paſſing through Jeruſalem, they returned into Galilee, to their own City Nazareth.</hi> Here ſeems between theſe two Texts, ſuch an Oppoſition concerning the Knowledge which our Lords Parents had of the City of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it beyond my Ability, to offer Reaſonable Terms, of agreeing theſe Two Evangeliſts, one with the other, upon this Particular. I am unwilling to ſurmiſe a Miſtake in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem, becauſe a great Part of the Verity of each of their Relations ſeems concerned in this Point; I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray the Aſſiſtance of Men more knowing and learned than my ſelf, to direct and ſupport me in theſe Depths, wherein I think Elephants may ſwim</p>
                  <p>A 6th. Inſtance of this kind, I take from <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.5. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Luke</hi> 7.2. In theſe Two Texts, our Two Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts relate the Circumſtances of one lame Fact. <hi>Mat.</hi> ſays, <hi>That our Lord being at Capernaum, there came to him a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, whoſe ſervant was ſick, and told our Lord, that his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was a Palſie. And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid, I will come and heal him: Nay, replies the Centurion, I am not worthy that thou ſhould'ſt come under my roof, but ſpeak the word only, and my ſervant ſhall be healed.</hi> Our Lord rejoins the Captain, and ſays, <hi>Go thy way, and as thou haſt believed, ſo be it done unto thee.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates it thus: <hi>This Centurions ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107192:47"/>was ready to die, and when he heard of Jeſus, he ſent unto him the Elders of the Jews, beſeeching him that he would come and heal his ſervant.</hi> And they came to Jeſus, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to do this Kindneſs for the Captain, becauſe he was a worthy Perſon, and a Lover of the Jews; and <hi>Jeſus</hi> went with them towards the Captain's Houſe, and when he was not far from thence, the Centurion ſent Friends to him, ſaying unto him, <hi>Lord, trouble not thy ſelf, for I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that thou ſhould'ſt enter under my Roof; wherefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought I my ſelf worthy to come unto thee, but ſay in a word, and my Servant ſhall be healed.</hi> And <hi>Jeſus</hi> thereupon turn'd him about, and diſcours'd with thoſe that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and they that were ſent, returning to the Houſe, found the Servant whole, that had been ſick. Upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two Relations, I think it plainly appears, That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Centurion came Perſonally to our Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt his Servant's Cure; or he did not come Perſonally to Chriſt for that purpoſe, but ſent the Elders of the Jews to requeſt that favour upon his behalf: Without that himſelf came either to Sight or Speech of our Lord upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I find no ground, or reaſonable gueſs, which of our Texts, deliver the abſolute Truth in this Circumſtance of the Fact, which they relate; but from this Variance, and the other Inſtances before recounted, I think it may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be collected, That Men are not bound to take, and perhaps ought not to take, every Saying, or Sentence, which they find written in the Scriptures, to be an irrefragable Truth, and the very Word of God. And I am ready to apply this Tenet to the Sayings now in diſpute with Mr. <hi>W.</hi> viz. <hi>Are not able to kill the Soul, and have no more that they can do.</hi> We find an apparent Variance between theſe Two Sayings, and that the Words of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> are adaequate, and anſwerable to the Intent of our Lord's Doctrine in this place; whereas thoſe of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> have a double Aſpect, and look as it were two ways: For one way it inſinuates, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107192:47"/>Perſecutors can do no more harm after they have killed: Another way it ſeems next to an Aſſertion, that Mens Souls live, and ſubſiſt in a ſtate of Seperation from their Bodies. I do not by the Context, or any other ways conceive, that our Lord did ſpeak, or had any Intent to ſpeak of the ſtate of Men after Death, in this Doctrine; whence the Words, <hi>Are not able to kill the Soul,</hi> in that Proſpect of intending to teach the ſtate of Men after Death, ſeems quite beſides our Lord's Meaning in this Doctrine; and if not quite out of it, yet very plainly collateral to it: And yet from this ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, the Maintainers of Seperate Subſiſtence, draw the ſtrongeſt Proof which they can find for maintaining their Opinion of the Seperate Subſiſtence. I think, that upon peruſal of this Argument, it will appear, the ſtrength of this Proof is much weaken'd and abated, and will be found to be of much leſs force, than it ſeems to have, at the firſt reading or hearing thereof; and in this ſtate of debilitation, I leave it, to proſecute my Obſervations upon Mr. <hi>W's</hi> Pages, as I did before.</p>
                  <p>P. 64 Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pretends to take the diſputed Words, as Comments one upon another, and ſays, that by Conſtruction they may be made to intend one thing: And I am ready to grant, that by Conſtruction, they may both of them be made, to ſerve the Meaning of our Lord in this Doctrine; but then, in our Collateral Point (which St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth not meddle with) there is a very great Variance between theſe two Expreſſions; for that the one proves ſtrongly the Soul's Seperate Subſiſtence, and the other proves it not, nor med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with it at all: Which proves, that our Lord's Doctrine did not intend to ſpeak of that Point in this place. And therefore our Queſtion thereupon is, In what Words our Lord delivered this Doctrine? And the Concluſion is, That if he delivered this Doctrine, in the Words of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> then they are a ſtrong Proof of the Souls Seperate Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; but if his Doctrine were delivered in the Words of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107192:48"/>St. <hi>Luke,</hi> then there is no Proof at all in it, of the Souls Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Subſiſtence. And I have before enough Argued on the ſide of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and for the Probability, that his Text ſets forth to us, the very Words wherein our Lord delivered this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> confeſſes, That <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth leſs than <hi>Matthew;</hi> but ſays, <hi>He never meant leſs.</hi> Which I think, intends, that the Meaning of <hi>Luke</hi> in his Text, was, That thoſe who kill the Body, are not able to kill the Soul: Which Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth not at all appear in the Words of <hi>Luke</hi>'s Text, which do not ſay ſo: And how then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſhould come to know that he meant ſo, I do not underſtand; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reject this Gloſs upon that Text, as Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or Fiction.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>P</hi> 66. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> diſcourſing upon this Text, ſays, <hi>That</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>appearing at Mount</hi> Tabor, <hi>muſt be either alive in Spirit only, or elſe his Body was raiſed.</hi> Adding, <hi>I know that ſome conjecture, that his Body was rais'd; but they cannot prove that Conjecture, from Texts of Scripture.</hi> And therefore he thinks it more likely, that <hi>Moſes appeared in Spirit only</hi> [in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending I ſuppoſe in his Soul ſubſiſting in a ſtate of Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after Death.] Which I think to be no more than a Conjecture, which he is not able to prove by Texts of Scripture, any more, than the former Conjecture can be ſo
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107192:48"/>Proved. And to theſe Two Conjectures, I pretend to add a Third, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> may not have died in the Mount but might be tranſlated, or tranſported to Heaven in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had before been: Which I offer to Prove, by his Appearing with <hi>Elias,</hi> at Mount <hi>Taber.</hi> It ſeems, they appeared both after a like manner, and the one as much in Perſon as the other. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> grants, that <hi>Elias</hi> did appear in Perſon; and <hi>Arguendo a ſimili,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt likely, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſo too. As to the Text, which ſays, <hi>Moſes died, and was buried;</hi> I think fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider by whom this Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> might be written, and if the Promiſes thereof might be written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or his Direction; yet this cloſing Paſſage of it, about his own Death, and Burial, it ſeems could not be ſo. It appears not from whence the Opinion of his Death and Burial was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, or how the Jews might come to know, that he ſo died, and was buried. <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Goe, get ye up into the Top of Piſgah, and take a view of the Land.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. ſays, <hi>Moſes went up from the Plains of Moab, to the Top of Piſgah, and died there.</hi> The Words of both Texts, ſeem to intend, that <hi>Moſes</hi> went up alone into the Top of this Mountain; and told the Jews before his going up, that he was to die there, and they never ſaw or heard more of him after that time; whence they might (according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of the World in ſuch Caſes) reaſonably enough conjecture, that he died there, and was buried according to the Cuſtom of the World, without finding any Evidence or Truth of ſuch a Burial. Whence I conceive his being buried, was but a Conjecture of the Jews, becauſe they could not find what was become of the Body, altho' pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they made a great Search for it. Whence I Collect, that his dying in the Mount, and his being buried there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, was but a Collection or Conjecture of the Jews, from his own not returning to them, and their not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find his Body by their moſt diligent Search. And
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107192:49"/>Collecting from theſe Premiſes, I am ready to infer, (as a Probability) that <hi>Moſes</hi> was tranſlated, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead nor buried, and yet was never ſeen, or heard of after, nor could they by ſearch find any place of his Burial, or what other ways was become of him; and I offer his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> as the beſt ground I have for this Conjecture; conceiving, that it might pleaſe God the Jews might not know of that Tranſlation; for that if they had known of his immediate going to Heaven, they might have been apt to direct Prayers thither to him, to intercede with God for their Nation, as he often ſucceſsfully did, whil'ſt he was here upon Earth. I have ſaid before, that Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s appearing at Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> in Soul only, cannot be proved by any Text of Scripture, is but his, or (at the moſt) a humane Conjecture: And I grant, that his appearing in Perſon at Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> is alſo a humane, but I think a more reaſonable Conjecture. And to this whole fifth Argument drawn from Mens Collections, and Conjectures thereupon, I Anſwer, That Men expect more Clear and Aſſertory Proofs of the Soul's Seperate Subſiſtence, than this, or ſuch like Arguments, can afford them.</p>

Mr. <hi>W.</hi> founds his Sixth Argument, upon that which is delivered to us in the Parable of <hi>Dives:</hi> And firſt, he grants that Relation to be a Parable, and not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Story; adding, <hi>That Parables are ſhadows of Diſcourſe, by which, are ſet forth things that are real and ſubſtantial.</hi> And I grant they may be Inſtructive, concerning thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for whoſe Illuſtration they were purpoſely delivered; and yet even in thoſe things I do not take them to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Mr <hi>W.</hi> ſays further, <hi>That</hi> Tertullian, Auguſtine, <hi>and the reſt of the Fathers, did much build their Faith (of the Souls Immortality, and of Mens Happineſs, or Miſery, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107192:49"/>after Death, before the Judgment of the Great Day) upon this Scripture.</hi> I obſerve, he avoids calling it, <hi>this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> I know not whether, what he ſays concerning the Fathers building their Belief of ſuch things upon this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, be true or not; but conceive, that if this Parable was really the principal Foundation of that Belief, it had but a very ſoft and ſandy Foundation; ſo as the building there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon erected, will not be enough able to reſiſt the Storms, Rains, and Floods, which may happen to aſſault it.</p>
                  <p>He further quotes <hi>Ireneus,</hi> and relates the groſs Errours, which he and <hi>Tertullian</hi> fell into, by following this Parable too cloſely, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far as to think, That a Seperated Soul has a Shape, Eyes, Mouth, and other like Members of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body.

                     <hi>P.</hi> 70. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> raiſes a Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Words and Senſe of this Parable, do ſpeak of and import, a State of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſently after their Death, or ſuch a State as ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them at the Reſurrection, and the laſt Judgment.</hi> And he ſpends divers Pages and Arguments, in Proving, That the Import of this Parable, points to a State, preſently ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parties Death, and not to that State which ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low low upon the Reſurrection; but his Labour to this Purpoſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107192:50"/>is needleſsly beſtowed upon me; or others, who may think as I do, That the Senſe of this Parable, intends a State pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſucceeding the Parties Death. Here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>Our Lord, by this Parable, intended to ſet forth an immediate ſtate of Happineſs for the Godly, and of Miſery for the Wicked.</hi> I Reply to this, That there appears no Evidence in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of our Lord's Intent, how to Teach by this Parable: There is no Diſcourſe in any Part of the Context, which might lead our Lord to ſpeak of the State of Perſons after Death; but the Context immediately fore-going, doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate and prove the ſpecial Intent of our Lord in this Parable, was to Illuſtrate and Confirm a Sentence, which himſelf had lately before uttered, <hi>viz. That there are things highly eſteemed among men, and yet are an Abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> And to this Purpoſe, he deſcribes the ſtate of <hi>Dives,</hi> with ſuch Circumſtances, as make it highly eſteem'd and deſired amongſt Men; and ſets <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſo low, and in a Condition ſo miſerable, as one can hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a worſe Condition amongſt Men; notwithſtanding whereof, the Sequel of the Parable declares, That the ſtate of <hi>Dives,</hi> though highly eſteemed amongſt Men, was in the whole of it, abominable to the ſight of God, and <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s ſtate, tho' abominated by Men, was in the whole, more bleſſed than that of <hi>Dives</hi> was: And I conceive thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that our preſent Parable was delivered by our Lord, with ſpecial Intent to illuſtrate this Doctrine, without any apparent Intent, to teach concerning the State of People af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death; and yet I do Agree, this Parable to ſet forth, or prove, that the common Opinion of the Jews at that time, was correſpondent to the Deſcriptions made in this Parable; but I conceive withal, that divers Particulars therein ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, prove it to be a Jewiſh Conception of that Time, and not an Intent of our Lord, to teach either Jews, or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, what the true ſtate of Men after Death, ſhould be. Firſt, It declares a great diſtance of ſpace, to be between
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107192:50"/>
                     <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and that there was a great Gulf fixed, ſo that none could paſs from the one Place to the other; and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dives,</hi> had a familiar Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, without ſtraining their Voices. Secondly, they ſaw, and knew, and ſpake to one another, without the uſe of Eyes, or Tongue, or Ears, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will ſuppoſe, although the Text do not declare it to be ſo; but ſpeaks of <hi>Dives,</hi> as having all theſe Members of a Man: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I Collect, That if this Text prove (any thing of the ſtate of Men after Death) it proves amongſt the reſt, that the Perſons ſuffering, have Eyes, and Ears, and Tongue, and like Bodily Members, and that the Suffering there, is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, if not only applied to the Body, and his Tongue being eminently tormented in that Flame, or Fire. Thirdly, this Parable imports, That the Tormented (and by the Rule of Contraries) the Happy Souls have Remembrance and Care, concerning thoſe things they left upon Earth, and concern themſelves about their Friends Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: Whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>The Dead know not any thing;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>That in Death, all Mens Thoughts periſh;</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> agrees, <hi>That all Concerns periſh with Death:</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> names particularly Mens Love and their Hatred. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38 18. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſings to God, <hi>The Grave cannot praiſe thee, Death cannot celebrate thee; they that go down into the Pit, cannot hope, but the Living can only praiſe Thee, as I do this day.</hi> And thereupon I leave to Conſideration, whether our Parable in this Point, do not oppoſe the fore-quoted, and divers other Texts of Scripture, and even the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Reformed Churches. Fourthly, I Recite a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obſervation, That if our Parable intended <hi>Dives</hi> to be in Hell, in his Soul only, then <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dives,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed both unproperly, and untruly, in calling one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Names of Father and Son: For that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Partakers, ſay, <hi>That was a Spirit newly created by God, which true Being and Subſiſtence, before it was infuſed,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107192:51"/>or injected into</hi> Dives, <hi>his newly procreated Body, without the Parents having any part in the Generation of it.</hi> Thus the Soul of <hi>Dives</hi> came not from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and how is he then his Son? <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.42. Our Lord quotes <hi>David</hi> calling Chriſt his Lord, and demands, <hi>How is he then his Son?</hi> And the Jews were not able to Anſwer him a word to that Queſtion. And this I apply to the Queſtion which I laſt asked, and from the Premiſes I conclude, that our Lord, did not by this Parable, intend to teach the true State of Men after Death, but to Illuſtrate that Aſſertion which he had before delivered by a Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, drawn from that Opinion which the Jews then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly held, of the State of Men after Death.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PAge</hi> 74. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes <hi>Luke</hi> 23. and recites the Hiſtory of the Thief upon the Croſs, and the Promiſe made to him by Chriſt, of his being with him in Paradiſe. I ſay thereto, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath urged this Proof before in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; and I have given him thereto ſuch an Anſwer, as ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies my own Underſtanding: And becauſe it is of ſome length, I have no mind here to repeat it, but rather make choice to offer an Argument raiſed from other Scriptures, in Impeachment of the Verity and Credit of this Relation; and begin with conſidering the Perſon of our Evangeliſt St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who was it ſeems converted to the Faith, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe <hi>Emanuenſis</hi> he is conceived to have been, in the writing of this Goſpel: And it ſeems, that this Evangeliſt was not converted, till divers years after our Lord's Crucifixion; and we know that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Infidel, but a Perſecuter of the Church, for ſome years after our Lord's Death. We no where find that either of them was preſent, beholding that Execution; and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, that neither of them were ſo. In the Proem to his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107192:51"/>Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> to <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſays thus: <hi>It ſeemed good to me, having had perfect underſtanding of all things, from the very firſt, to write unto ye in order, even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were Eye-witneſſes, and Miniſters of the Word.</hi> Thus he profeſſes to write, from the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other Men, who had been Eye-witneſſes of them, and Miniſters of the Word: And of thoſe Traditions, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, this Relation of the Crucified Thief's Converſion, to be one. If we ſhall conſider the other Three Evangeliſts, we muſt find them totally ſilent concerning this Fact; and that they do not concur with St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in their Teſtimonies concerning it. We have good Aſſurance that St. <hi>John</hi> was preſent at our Lord's Suffering, and continued with him till the Time of his Expiration; and yet he takes no Notice, nor makes any Mention of this Thief's Converſion: And yet I think the Fact was ſo Remarkable, as deſerved to be Recorded, if he had known it to be done. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> was one of the Twelve called by Chriſt to be of his Apoſtles, and continued Faithful to him to the end; whence it ſeems likely, he might be one of the Beholders of this Tragedy, and yet he makes no Mention of this Thief's Converſion.</p>
                  <p>Men generally ſuppoſe, That <hi>Mark</hi> writ his Goſpel from the Mouth of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and very probable it is, that that great Apoſtle was preſent at the Suffering of his Maſter; and yet St. <hi>Mark</hi> makes no Mention at all of this Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And hereupon it ſeems to deſerve our Enquiry, How <hi>Luke,</hi> who was not preſent at that Fact, ſhould come to know the Particulars of it, when the other Three; Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, either did not know it, or have utterly ſuppreſs'd their Knowledge and the Mention of it. The Silence of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Three Evangeliſts, ſeems a competent Ground to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Verity of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Relation; but that is not all, for Two other of the Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> give an oppoſite and contrarient Teſtimony, to that which St. <hi>Luke</hi> delivers concerning it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.44. <hi>There were two
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107192:52"/>Thieves crucified with our Lord, and the People which paſſed by whil'ſt he was on the Croſs, reviled him, ſaying, Save thy ſelf if thou be the Son of God, and come down from the Croſs: And the Thieves alſo which were crucified with him, caſt the ſame in his teeth.</hi> Which I conceive to be a True and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Tranſlation of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Greek Words. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.27. With Chriſt <hi>they crucified two Thieves, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left; and they that paſſed by, railed on him: and they that were crucified with him, reviled him.</hi> Both theſe Texts in Greek agree in their Expreſſions. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.44. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, by, <hi>Caſting in his Teeth;</hi> and in <hi>Mark</hi> they have render'd it by the Word <hi>Reviling,</hi> both which Tranſlations import the ſame Actings in theſe Places: But both theſe Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts agree <hi>in Terminis,</hi> in their Plural Expreſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> that they who were Crucified with him did this, [they both did ſo.] Whence it ſeems conſequent, That the one did not Rebuke the other for doing ſo, and became thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and rewarded, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates the Matter of this Fact. I have ſaid before, that the Silence of the other Three Evangeliſts, may give a reaſonable occaſion, for Men to doubt the Verity of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Relation; and then, that the Oppoſition which is thereunto made, by the concurrent Teſtimony of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> evidencing the contrary, ſeems to be a firm Ground for Doubting, and even for Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Truth of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Relation, concerning this Converſion, and the Promiſe of our Lord, upon which his whole Argument is grounded, and muſt finally fail with the Verity of that Relation. I have ſaid before, that my firſt Anſwer given to this Argument, ſatisfies my own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and I now thereunto Add, If I had not ſo good an Anſwer to his Argument, as hath before been given, I ſhould be very apt to conceive, that the Cauſes which I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107192:52"/>have here produced, of doubting the Verity of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Relation, would be a good and ſufficient Anſwer to that Argument which M. <hi>W.</hi> hath drawn from ſo Queſtionable a Relation, which ſeems to make the Ground of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhake under him; convincing, that no firm Argument can be drawn from ſo infirm and ſandy a Relation.</p>

                     <hi>PAge</hi> 59. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Argues Eighthly, from our Lord's words, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit;</hi> and St. <hi>Steven</hi>'s words, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit:</hi> Where he will have the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> to ſignifie and intend the Souls of theſe Petitioners, conceived by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Party, to ſubſiſt in a State of Seperation from the Body. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath before offered in this Treatiſe, and there I have given it ſuch an Anſwer, as ſatisfies my own Underſtanding, and there neither need, nor can give any other Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, without repeating what I have there alleady deliver'd. I have ſaid there, that in both theſe Petitions, the Greek Word or Term of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, is uſed; and that our Tranſlators have render'd it in Engliſh by the word <hi>Spirit;</hi> but that its Natural Signification intends <hi>Breath,</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> indifferently, and may be warrantably Tranſlated by either of theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Terms, according as the Subject, or Matter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe may require: And therefore I impute no fault nuto our Tranſlators, for rendering it by the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> as they have done, conceiving it was intended, by the word <hi>Spirit</hi> in this Place, to ſignifie the Spirit of Life in Man, which is one of the two Conſtituent Parts of his Perſon, and by the ordinary figure of <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> ſetting one Part for the Whole; the word <hi>Spirit</hi> here, ſeems to intend the whole Perſon: So as under this Term of <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Petitioners
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107192:54"/>intended to recommend themſelves, or their whole Perſons, the one into the hands of his Father, under whoſe Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his Body, as well as his Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> his whole Perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and was preſerved, without ſeeing Corruption, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Time and Hour of his Reſurrection: And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Prayer was made in a like Senſe, and to the ſame Purpoſe that our Lord's was.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays further, <hi>He does not know of any ſuch Phraeſed Petitions as theſe are, put up by either of them, or any other Perſon, in Prayer, but juſt at the Moment of dying.</hi> I will therefore refreſh his Memory, by quoting to him, and our Readers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.6. where the very ſame Words are uſed: <hi>Into thy hands I commend my Spirit; for thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of Truth.</hi> (For any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) the Pſalmiſt was in Health at the uttering of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; but withal, in a ſtate of great Trouble, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſes teſtifie. And it thence ſeems ſomewhat Clear to my Underſtanding, that by theſe Words, our Prophet did not intend, to recommend to God's Protection, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life, or Seperative Soul only, but that rather in thoſe Words, he intended, to recommend to God's Care and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, his whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Soul and Body, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or himſelf, without having any particular, or ſingular Reſpect to his Spirit of Life, or Soul, whatſoever the ſame might be: Which ſeems may be ſomewhat mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 80. he ſays, <hi>If his Interpretation of thoſe Words be true, they clearly expreſs the Souls Immortality.</hi> I do not deny this, but withal conceive, that his Interpretation of theſe Words, is not true, as my fore-going Anſwers teſtifie; and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107192:54"/>then I think no man can believe, that they are a good Proof, or any Proof at all, for the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 82. he ſays, <hi>The Word Spirit here, intends Seperate Soul;</hi> and if it doth not mean ſo, he deſires to know what it doth mean: And I have ſaid before, that it intends the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Petitioner, as it is a <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> farther demands, <hi>What the word Spirit here means, and whether it mean the Life of the Body.</hi> Here I am at a loſs what he means, by <hi>the Life of the Body;</hi> and if he doth not mean the Life of the Perſon, he means that which hath no good Senſe in it; for the Body, <hi>quatenus tale,</hi> or divided from the Perſon, hath no ſort of Life in it; as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>A Body without a Spirit, is dead:</hi> And therefore, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Life of the Body, without a Figurative Intent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to the Nature of a Bull; in ſuch manner, as if one ſhould ſpeak of the Life of a dead thing.

                     <hi>PAge</hi> 83. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11. <hi>And if Chriſt be in you, the Body is dead, becauſe of ſin; but the Spirit is Life, becauſe of Righteoſneſs; and if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead, dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken your Mortal Bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> And he ſays upon this Text, <hi>Methinks this Truth of the Souls Immortality, doth very clearly ſhine in the Evidence of this Scripture.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That what ſhines ſo clearly to him, I do not at all diſcover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 84. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> proceeds in a long Diſcourſe, which I think rather confounds and miſleads, than opens and declares the Meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words; and yet I have no Intent to implicate my ſelf with him upon that Subject, eſpecially in many Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 85. He raiſes an Exception out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, but I think it is out of his own Brain and Invention, not perceiving, that <hi>Paul</hi> thought of ſuch an Objection; nor that he makes or intends any Anſwer to it: But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himſelf both tells the Tale, and gives the Anſwer. And there he ſays further, <hi>If you ask, How comes the Soul thus to over-live the Body?</hi> He Anſwers, by a perplex'd Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of ſome other Words in the Chapter, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Expound, as by an Old Rule, <hi>Mala Expoſitio cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpit Textum;</hi> and then he draws out of that Expoſition, what I do not find in the Text, but will not particularize, for avoiding of Length and Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 86. Here he Propounds another Objection to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, and ſays, <hi>The Apoſtle was well aware of it, and therefore gave it an Anſwer.</hi> But I think he is miſtaken in both, not finding by the Text, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ever thought of it; and therefore did not deſign to give it an Anſwer;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107192:55"/>and ſpecially, ſuch an Anſwer as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in this Place hath done. He proceeds, and raiſes a Third Objection againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, but doth not ſay the Apoſtle was aware of this, or made any Anſwer to it; but Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Invention and Conſtruction, are ready to give it a full Anſwer; but not ſuch an one as I am willing to Conſent unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 87. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>Having thus cleared up the Text, by giving you its Meaning, I proceed now to lay down my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to prove, that the Soul of Man dieth not with the Body.</hi> I Anſwer, ſome other Man may poſſibly ſay, Having now confounded and implicated the Meaning of this Text by my Expoſition I am enough by that means enabled to prove thereby, the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, which from the Text it ſelf, without ſuch handling of it, I ſhould not be able to have done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 88. He pretends to prove, <hi>The Soul not ſubject to Death, becauſe nothing is ſo, that is not ſubject to the Power of Death, and the Soul of the Believer is not ſo.</hi> I look upon this as a vain ſort of Argument, and begging of the Queſtion, increaſing the Bulk of his Treatiſe, but adding no ſtrength to his Proof. Here again he ſpeaks of the Soul, by the Term of <hi>Her</hi> and <hi>She,</hi> as if he had prov'd her a Seperately diſtinct thing from the Man, or Perſon, a thing neither granted to him, nor proved by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 89. He ſays again, <hi>The Spirit of a Believer, is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of Death:</hi> Which is the very Point in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and denied by his Oppoſers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 90. He pretends, <hi>That by what he hath ſaid, it appears, that the Law of Death is executed only on the Body of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</hi> I Anſwer, that to me appers no ſuch thing, but that the Law of Death is executed upon the Perſons, both of Believers and Unbelievers, and that Death paſs'd upon all, for that all have ſinned; and do Agree with him, that not only the Body ſhall be rais'd at the Laſt Day, but that the whole Perſon ſhall be ſo rais'd to appear in Judgment,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107192:56"/>before the Tribunal of Chriſt: And withal I conceive, that our Author goes far for Arguments to prove his Tenet, when he catches at, and ſeems to rely upon ſuch precarious Conſtructions, as he hath offered in this Argument.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 91. Hereupon Mr. <hi>W.</hi> with good reaſon places the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the meaning of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> doubled Expreſſion, of being in the body, and abſent from Chriſt; and being out of the body, and preſent with Chriſt; and then ſaith, That when <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>We are confident,</hi> that here by the <hi>We,</hi> that are always confident, he intends, the Soul or Spirit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Soul and Spirit of the reſt of the Believing Church: And if this be the true meaning of our Apoſtle in this Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That here is intended the Souls of him and his brethren, which at death will be abſent from their bodies, and be preſent with the Lord; <hi>Then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it proves the Souls of Men Seperate, and are Immortal: but the former,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is true, therefore the later</hi> Then he offers to prove, that by the <hi>We,</hi> who would be abſent from the body, the Apoſtle intends the Souls only of himſelf and other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; for what elſe is that of the Saints, <hi>that is abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord?</hi> Name the thing if you can; <hi>for,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it cannot mean the body nor the whole perſon; not the whole perſon, for that the whole man cannot be ſaid to be at home in one part of the man,</hi> viz. <hi>his body; or abſent from it; for the whole of anything cannot be contained in a part of it. P.</hi> 93. Then Mr. <hi>W</hi> puts a weak Objection againſt himſelf, and anſwers it. Upon this Argument I Agree with him,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107192:56"/>that the Difficulty lies, in finding out what St. <hi>Paul</hi> intends by the <hi>We, that would be abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord:</hi> Whether it intends the Souls only of the Faithful, or their whole Perſons? He ſays, <hi>It can only intend Mens Souls:</hi> But I conceive, that it intends their Perſons. And firſt, I Argue from the Apoſtles Terms of Expreſſion, and do think, that if by the Term <hi>We,</hi> he only intended Mens Souls, he hath very improperly expreſs'd ſuch a Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for that if there be many Perſons in an Aſſembly or Company, and one of them ſpeaking for the reſt, ſays, We decree, or expect, or deſire, ſuch a thing, how can it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined, that the Speaker, intends only the Souls of thoſe Perſons do expect or deſire? And therefore, if our Apoſtle, by his Term <hi>We,</hi> did intend only the Souls of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, I conceive it would have been hard for Men to have found out that Meaning, without ſuch an Aſſiſtance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here offers them. I think the proper Signification of the Word <hi>We,</hi> in ſuch Caſes, is to denote the Men or the Perſons, who are ſaid to do any thing, and not any one Part or Parcel of ſuch Perſons, as it muſt do in this place, if it intended only the Souls of Believers. I take it for an old and good Rule amongſt Expoſitors, that they ſhould caſt their Eyes upon the Contexts of thoſe Places which they mean to Expound, that thereby they may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole Scheme or Plat-form of the Writer's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then to employ their Talent, in drawing all that the Writer ſays, to prove his Meaning or fortifie his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And therefore, I proceed to ſearch what our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays in his next fore-going Chapter concerning this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.10. <hi>We are caſt down but not deſtroyed, always bearing about in the Body the dying of our Lord Jeſus.</hi> By Body I think the whole Perſon is here intended. The Text adds, <hi>That the Life of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our Body</hi> [or Perſon.] <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. <hi>We know, that he which raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Lord JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, ſhall raiſe up us alſo by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,

Chap. 5.1. <hi>We know that if our Earthly Houſe of this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle were diſſolved, we have a Building of God; an Houſe, not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. For in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our Houſe which is from Heaven. And we that are in this Tabernacle do groan. being burthen'd; not for that we would be uncloath'd, but cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, that Mortality might be ſwallowed up of Life: And we are always confident, knowing that whilſt we are at home in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord. We are confident I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord: And we labour, that whether preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we may be accepted of him; for we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad.</hi> Theſe Quotations have been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, for making it appear, that the Intent of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in theſe Texts, was to diſcover to his Readers, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Reſurrection, and the Laſt judgment.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Diſcourſe, makes no mention at all of Death, or Dying, or any ſort of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107192:58"/>Seperation of the Soul from the Body, but ſeems to reject that Intent, when he ſays, <hi>He does not deſire to be uncloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Which I think, intends to die; but deſires to be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, that Mortality might be ſwallowed up of Life: Which will clearly be effected, by changing his Fleſhly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body, into a Spiritual, or Heavenly Body, in which Men ſhall be preſent with the Lord for ever. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it doth not yet appear, what we ſhall be, but me know that when He</hi> [Chriſt] <hi>ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, and our vile Bodies ſhall be chang'd, and made like his Glorious Body.</hi> It may alſo be obſerved, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> intends by his Term <hi>We;</hi> for in the quoted Text, he ſays <hi>We deſire to be abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord:</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſays, <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed.</hi> Alſo, <hi>We that are alive, ſhall not prevent them that are aſleep.</hi> Alſo, <hi>We ſhall be caught up to the Clouds, to meet the Lord, and remain ever with him.</hi> In all theſe <hi>We's,</hi> it ſeems plain, the Apoſtle intends, the Perſons of Believers, and not their Souls only. Concerning this Deſire of being <hi>Abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord,</hi> it ſeems obſervable, That the Church of that time expected our Lord's Second Coming, within ſome indifferent, or ſhort ſpace, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Time, ſuch as that poſſibly ſome of them might live till the Accompliſhment of it. Our Lord ſpeaking of the Signs of his Coming, ſays, <hi>This Generation ſhall not paſs, until all things be fulfilled:</hi> And elſe-where tells his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the Signs and Glory of his Second Coming, and ſays, <hi>Then look up, and lift up your heads, for your Redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh;</hi> as if ſome of them might live unto that Time. In the Apoſtolick Writings, we often find their Times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, by the Terms of Laſt Time; and they thought that upon them, the Ends of the World were come: and we find it written, <hi>The time is ſhort, therefore he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill; and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill:</hi> As if there were ſcarce time of a REFORMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION

                     <hi>PAge</hi> 94. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. <hi>I knew a man about fourteen years ago, whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell:</hi> Ver 3. <hi>And I knew ſuch a man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107192:59"/>in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell; how that he was caught up into Paradiſe, and heard unſpeakable words, not lawful to be uttered.</hi> Hence Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays he argues, That what is capable of being ſeperated from the Body, and in this Seperate State to be in Paradiſe; and in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, to hear Words ſpoken, that muſt needs be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but the Soul is capable of all this: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Firſt, he pretends to prove the Souls Capacity of being ſeperated from the Body [which all Readers will preſently perceive to be the very Point hitherto diſputed between us,] but the beſt Proof which he brings thereof, is his own Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, that the Apoſtle knew it to be ſo ſeperable; and thereupon he ſays, <hi>The Apoſtle thought there was ſome ſuch part of himſelf, as might be ſeperable from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for no Man can ever doubt the Being of a Thing, which he knows is uncapable to be:</hi> And hereupon he thinks the Apoſtle doth evidently ſuppoſe, his Soul was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being out of the Body: which amounts to thus much, that he ſuppoſes the Apoſtle ſuppoſes the thing to be as he would have it; whereas in the Text we find no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch things as he ſuppoſes; for in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, there is no mention made of a Soul, or any other Part of the Perſon, that ever did, or can ſubſiſt in a State of Seperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Body. Next, there is no mention made of a Seperation of any thing from the Body: Nor is it ſaid, that any Part or Parcel of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Perſon, was ſeperated from himſelf; or that there was any one Parcel of him divided from his Perſon; and much leſs, that the Divided Part could ſubſiſt in a State of Seperation from the Body: Whence I conceive, that what he here ſays concerning a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of one Part of St <hi>Paul,</hi> from another, ſprings from his own pregnant Invention, without finding any good ground for it in the Text; or that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did by his Words, either in the Body, or out of the Body, intend to teach, or diſcover to his Proſelites, that the Soul could be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107192:59"/>ſeperated from the Body; and much leſs, that it could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by its ſelf in ſuch a State of Seperation from the Body: But I conceive with ſome Clearneſs, our Apoſtles Meaning in thoſe Words, <hi>In the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or out of the Body,</hi> was very different from Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Suppoſals, and intended only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thus much, That himſelf had been caught [or rapt] up, into the Third Heavens, where he heard unſpeakable Words, not lawful to be uttered; and that he was in ſome doubt, whether this Rapture was of his whole Perſon, or of his Mind, or Intellect only. The things which were reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in this Rapture, he had ſo clear and perfect a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of, as he thought he could not more clearly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have underſtood them, if they had been perceived by his Bodily Senſes of Hearing and Seeing; and therefore he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that this Rapture might be of his whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and that he did hear and ſee with his Bodily Organs, thoſe things which were then revealed to him; and yet, becauſe ſuch Raptures of the Perſon had not before been known, he thought there was great Reaſon to doubt of that kind of Rapture; and from grounds of Reaſon and Practice, to conceive, That this Rapture was more likely to be of his Mind and Intellect only, than of his whole Perſon, Body and Soul together: And for the better proving the Apoſtles Intent in this Place, to be ſuch as before is ſaid, ſome other Texts of Scripture ſhall be produced, wherein Facts, parallel to this Rapture, are related: <hi>Acts</hi> 10.9. ſays, Another great Apoſtle, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> went up upon the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Houſe to pray, and there he fell into a Trance, and ſaw Heaven opened, and a Veſſel deſcending unto him, like a great Sheet faſtened at the four Corners, and there came a Voice to him, ſaying, <hi>Peter,</hi> Kill and Eat: <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf; upon which, a ſecond Voice called to him, ſaying, <hi>What God hath cleanſed, call not thou common.</hi> And it ſeems, theſe things were perceived by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as if he had ſeen and heard them by his Bodily Organs; and they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107192:60"/>were as well imprinted upon his Memory: For he told <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> and his Company, that God had ſhewed him [late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] that he ſhould not call any Man common, or unclean. This Apoſtle might be well enough aſſured, that this was not a Raptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of his whole Perſon, but a Trance, or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport of his Mind only; and yet he perceived things as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, as if he had heard and ſeen them with his Bodily Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.334. <hi>Balaam took up his Parable, and ſaid, the Man whoſe Eyes are opened, hath ſaid: He hath ſaid, which heard the Words of God, which ſaw the Viſion of the Almighty, falling into a Trance but having his eyes open.</hi> Ver. 15. He repeats the ſame Words of falling into a Trance, and having his Eyes open; and then reveals to <hi>Balak</hi> and his Court, the utter Deſtruction of <hi>Amalek</hi> by <hi>Saul;</hi> and that Ships ſhall come from the Coaſt of <hi>Chittim,</hi> and afflict <hi>Aſhur</hi> and <hi>Eber:</hi> Which ſeems to intend the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Invaſion of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and poſſibly the <hi>Roman</hi> alſo. <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. ſays, <hi>I ſhall ſee him, but not now; I ſhall behold him, but not nigh; there ſhall come a Star out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and a Scepter ſhall riſe out of</hi> Iſrael. By which great things ſhall be done, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly interpreted, to intend Chriſt and his Kingdom, the ſpace of 1500 years before the ſame appeared. It ſeems, though <hi>Balaam</hi> in this Trance had his Eyes open, yet he ſaw not theſe Revelations, or Viſions, with his Bodily Eyes, but by the perceptive Power of his Mind, which was all this while intranced; and though the Body was Partaker of this Trance, yet were the Bodily Senſes no Acters in it, but all was done by the perceptive Powers of his Mind intranced. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22, 19. The Prophet <hi>Micaiah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Imiah,</hi> ſays thus to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah, I ſaw the Lord ſitting on his Throne, and all the Hoſt of Heaven ſtanding by him on his right hand, and on his left:</hi> And then he ſaw alſo a Spirit, which came and ſtood forth before the Lord, and declared how he would entice <hi>Ahab,</hi> to go up and fall at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead.</hi> It ſeems hereupon, that this Prophet
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107192:60"/>was rapt into Heaven, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was; for that in any other Place he could not have ſeen the things here related; and which he ſays he ſaw and perceived as clearly as if he had ſeen them with his Bodily Eyes and Ears; and was full of Confidence, that they would prove true as they did: And yet I conceive, that this Rapture was only of his Mind, and that to him ſo intranced, all theſe things were perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.1. <hi>John looked and behold a door was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Heaven, and he heard a Voice as it were of a Trumpet, which ſaid, Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee things which muſt be hereafter; and immediately he was in the Spirit, and behold a Throne was ſet in Heaven.</hi> And from thence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes his Revelation of things afterwards to be performed. Our Apoſtle doth not ſay here, That his Spirit was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported into Heaven, or that he was there in his Soul only; but ſays, <hi>Immediately I was in the Spirit</hi> [I my ſelf was there my Perſon was there in the Spirit:] So that, all which was there revealed, was ſo revealed to himſelf, or Perſon, without Mention of any Seperation of his Soul from his Body, any more than St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath mentioned it in his proving Text. Whence I conceive, that during the ſpace of this Revelation, St. <hi>John</hi> was in a Rapture, or Tranſport of his Mind, as other Prophets had been before him; and yet he had ſo perfect a Perception of the things revealed, and was ſo well aſſured of the Truth of them, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered them ſo well, as if he had perceived and known them with his Bodily Senſes of Seeing and Hearing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered them as well; and he might poſſibly be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, whether this was a Rapture of his Perſon into Heaven, or that it was only a Rapture of his Mind,, wherein this Revelation was made to him. I have quoted theſe Four Parallel Texts of Scripture, to evince, or perſwade, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in our Proving Text, did not doubt whether his Soul was actually ſeperated from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but whether his Rapture into the Third Heaven, was a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107192:61"/>Tranſport of his Perſon thither, or whether this Tranſport was only a Rapture of his Mind. I am (by what hath been ſaid) ſatisfied in my own Underſtanding, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not intend in this Text, to teach concerning the Seperation of the Soul from the Body, or that the Soul could ſubſiſt in ſuch a State of Seperation; and therefore I think, that the Argument which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> draws from this Text, for Proof the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, is unſound and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and is by no means a good Proof of the Souls Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Subſiſtence.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 98. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Objects thus againſt his own Argument, That <hi>Paul</hi> in this Text, ſpeaks not a Word of his Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107192:61"/>only of himſelf, or his whole Perſon, and that it is not fair for Mr. <hi>W.</hi> to argue a greater happineſs of his Soul on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Death, from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeaking of a better condition that himſelf ſhould enjoy at Death. To this Objection he anſwers, That <hi>Paul</hi> muſt in this Text, when he ſpeaks of himſelf, only be underſtood, as intending his Soul, becauſe Death could not poſſibly be again to his Body, nor could Death bring him to a more bleſſed preſence with Chriſt, than he had whilſt alive: And againſt his own Doctrine he puts another Objection, <hi>P.</hi> 99. as if ſome had ſaid, That <hi>Pauls</hi> deſire to be with Chriſt after Death, was only in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of happineſs at the Reſurrection. Then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> anſwers this Objection, which is not owned by me, or any other which I have heard or read of; and therefore it paſſes with me for another Man of Straw, ſet up by himſelf to be batter'd down again by the ſame hand. Phil. 20. <hi>I hope that in nothing I ſhall be aſhamed, but that Chriſt ſhall be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in my body, whether it be by life or by death; for to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain: but if I live in the fleſh, this is the fruit of my labour: what I ſhould chuſe I wot not, but am in a ſtrait betwixt two; having a deſire to depart and be with Chriſt, which is far better: nevertheleſs, to abide in the fleſh is more needful for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I obſerve upon this Text, that there is no mention of the Soul made in it, although there is mention of the Body, that Chriſt ſhall be magnified in it; intending his Perſon, by the Name of his Body. In all the reſt of the Text there is nothing elſe denoted, but by the Terms of I and Me; both which do properly denote and ſignifie the Perſon and all that which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has raiſed out of this Text, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul or its Subſiſtence in a Seperate State from the Body, ſeems to be the proper effect of his own Invention, and not really founded upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Text before quoted. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath ſaid from the Text, <hi>That to die is gain, and that to die is better than to live here.</hi> Theſe two Sayings
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107192:62"/>may I think be very properly applied to the Perſon; that it may be gain for ſome Perſons to die, rather than live; and conſequently, that it is better for ſuch Perſons to die, than to live here.</p>

Philip.</hi> 4.14. The <hi>Philippians</hi> had ſent a Preſent to ſupply St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Wants, and in return he ſays, <hi>Ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my Affliction, and ſupply my Wants;</hi> and prays God to bleſs them for their ſo doing. The ſeveral Texts thus collected, ſeem to declare to us, the State of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Perſon at that time; <hi>He was Paul the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, a Priſoner,</hi> under a neceſſitous and wanting Condition, ready to be offered up by a dolorous Death, having but lately
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107192:62"/>eſcaped out of the Mouth of the Lion; and that he lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually under great Afflictions for the Church's ſake, and had the Care of all the Churches lying upon him: All which Particulars conſidered, our Apoſtle had great Reaſon to chuſe Death, rather than Life in all ſuch Reſpects as did only concern himſelf; for that by Death, he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the manifold Afflictions and Tribulations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named, and thereby attain a ſtate of Reſt and Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Lord. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>John</hi> heard a Voice from Heaven, commanding him to write, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord; yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them.</hi> Rom. 14.8. <hi>Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.</hi> Chap. 8.35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeperate us from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> Ver. 38. <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeperate us from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus' our Lord.</hi> Here we may obſerve, Life and Death are made indifferent things to Believers, ſuch as ſeem neither to hinder, nor further the State or Condition of them; or to be either of them greatly deſired by Chriſtians in this World, but rather ought to be referr'd to the Will and Appointment of God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.38. God calls Himſelf, <hi>The God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, and yet the Text ſays, <hi>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto him.</hi> Which to my Apprehenſion, proves what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaid, <hi>That whether we live or die, we are the Lord</hi>'s; during Life, we live and move in Him; and when we die, we reſt and ſleep in Him, in expectation to be raiſed by Him at his Second Coming. And from the Premiſes I Argue, That all Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Suppoſitions and Surmiſes, concerning the Soul, and the Seperate State of it, are ill grounded and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound. We read of many Perſons, whoſe Conditions were ſo much diſtreſs'd, that with <hi>Job</hi> they have heartily deſir'd
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107192:63"/>Death, and would be ready with him to dig for it, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men would do for hidden Treaſure; the very Aged and Sickly [one of which I am] will eaſily be perſwaded, to think Death a Gain to them, and to deſire it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The preſent Time affords a rare Example, of a young, rich, and otherwiſe happy Lord, who by a Piſtol Bullet took away his own Life at the <hi>Bath,</hi> meerly to rid and free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſuch ſharp Pains of the Gout and Stone, as then op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd him: And daily Experience aſſures us, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Hope of Death, is one of the greateſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports under Mens preſent Sufferings, and is by ſuch Perſons accordingly deſired; and thus they are at apparent Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>That for them to die is Gain,</hi> although their Expectations of future Happineſs, may be nothing ſo well grounded as his was. It may be alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>I have a deſire to depart, and be with Chriſt, which is far better:</hi> Not ſaying, He deſir'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, that he might be with Chriſt; but that though he did depart, he knew he ſhould ſtill be with Chriſt, ſo as his Departure and being with Chriſt, do both ſtand well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; he had a Being with Chriſt, whil'ſt he was alive, and he doubted not of having a like Being with Chriſt, when he was dead; and that a more peaceable and quiet Being, than he had whil'ſt he was here; and therefore that Eſtate was the more deſirable, and the more gainful. If a Perſon go to his Friends, or his Father's Houſe, he may truly he ſaid to be with ſuch a Friend or Father, either ſleeping or waking; and we know Death is compared to a Sleep, the Scripture uſually calls it ſo; and really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is no other, but a ſound and laſting Sleep, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue unto the Sound of the laſt Trumpet, at whoſe Summons the Dead ſhall be raiſed; and thoſe who are alive upon Earth, ſhall have their Perſons changed. St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not ſay, that he, or any other Perſon, is more preſent with the Lord when dead, than alive; but that in both Eſtates, Men are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107192:63"/>alike preſent with the Lord: For, <hi>If we live, we live unto the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the Lord; ſo as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we live or die, we are the Lord's.</hi> Neither Death nor Life can ſeperate us from the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus. So it ſeems, whether we live or die, we are alike with Chriſt, and have no more Being with him dead, than when alive; but that in both theſe States we have alike Being with him. This Expoſition of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preſent Text, I conceive to be ſound and true; and that Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s is Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous: For that, this my Conſtruction applies St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Terms of <hi>I</hi> and <hi>Me,</hi> to denote and intend his whole Perſon, as in their proper Signification they do; whereas Mr. <hi>W.</hi> applies them, to ſignifie only one Part of his Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> our Author's ſort of Soul, concerning which, our Diſpute is, Whether there is any ſuch thing in the World, or not. Next Mr. <hi>W.</hi> takes up the Bulk of his Argument, in a Diſcourſe concerning the Soul, its Seperate Subſiſtence after Death, and its enjoying Happineſs in that Eſtate; whereas, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s whole Text, there are no words which mention any of theſe things, or give us any Information concerning them, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them. I leave therefore his Conſtruction, as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of the Apoſtle's Meaning, and think I have Reaſon to conclude, That Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Argument drawn from this Text, is not a ſufficient, nor a good Argument to prove the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the Soul, in a State of Seperation from the Body.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 101. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>There were Souls of Men in Heaven, when St.</hi> Paul <hi>writ this Epiſtle; becauſe the Apoſtle ſays, there
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107192:64"/>were things in Heaven reconciled by the Blood of the Croſs:</hi> But there are no ſuch things in Heaven reconciled by the Blood of the Croſs, except they be the Souls of ſome Holy Men that went hence: Then he expreſſes a Deſire to know what Men can ſay to this Argument. And therefore I ſay to it, That by his own Expreſſion it appears, he ſays he knows not what; for he ſays, <hi>He knows not that there are any other things in Heaven, which need Reconciliation to God by Chriſt, except Men will take theſe things to be the Souls of departed Perſons.</hi> But if Men will not accept of this Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then he knows not what the Apoſtle can mean, <hi>by things in Heaven reconciled to God by Chriſt:</hi> Which intends no more, than that he doth not otherways know, what the <hi>Things in Heaven reconciled to God by Chriſt,</hi> may mean: Which I take for a Confeſſion, That he doth not know what <hi>Paul</hi> meant by theſe things in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I conceive he doth not know, that there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls in Heaven; becauſe if he did, he ſhould be able to make ſuch a Demonſtration, or Deſcription of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of their being there, as other Men, who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, might be able to underſtand and conceive. He hath taken Pains to write this Treatiſe, and therein hath already produced Thirteen Arguments in Proof of this Tenet, but very unſucceſsfully, as thoſe who peruſe theſe Obſervations will eaſily diſcover. The Peruſers of this Argument, will I think eaſily find, That Mr. <hi>W.</hi> muſt have Two Things grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, before he can pretend to prove any thing by this Argument. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there are no things in Heaven, which need Reconciliation to God, unleſs Men will admit, that Humane Souls are there. And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> he would perſwade Men to admit of his Poſition, That there are Souls in Heaven. But I think fit to reject both theſe Propoſals, and ſay, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there may be other Things in Heaven, beſides Souls, which may need a Reconciliation to God by Chriſt. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> to conceive, that poſſibly, or even
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107192:64"/>probably, there are not, nor ever were, any Humane Souls in Heaven, nor in any other Place in the World, except in their own proper and peculiar Bodies.

He ſays, <hi>We have a Right to the Society of thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt Men mude perfect, which we ſhall have in poſſeſſion when we depart hence:</hi> But I find neither ſuch Words, nor Things, in his Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That we ſhall come to that Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety when we depart hence; ſo as I muſt repute it his own Addition to the Words of the Text, which doth not appoint the Time for our coming to that Society. I find Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has only quoted ſo much of this Text, as ſeemeth moſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his own Opinion; and therefore I intend to quote it ſomewhat more largely. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Ye are come unto Mount Sion, and to the Heavenly Jeruſalem, or City of God, to the Company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly and Church of the firſt Born; and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant.</hi> Ver. 25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh, whoſe Voice (at the giving of the Law) ſhook the Earth; but now he hath promiſed, ſaying, yet once more I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven; and this ſignifies the removal of thoſe things which are ſhaken, and that we ſhall receive a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which cannot be removed.</hi> The Words of our Text thus fully quoted, do by no means import, That Men or their Souls, ſhall come to the enjoyment of thoſe things at their Deaths, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath erroneouſly ſuggeſted, but the words of the Text run in the preſent Tenſe, Ye are come to the things which I here report to you, <hi>viz.</hi> Ye are come to the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jeruſalem, to the Angels, and to the general Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt Born, when not only the Earth ſhall be ſhaken, but alſo Heaven, and the things ſo ſhaken ſhall be removed. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Deſcription here made, doth very properly denote, the Time of the Reſurrection, and the great Day of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107192:65"/>Judgment; For at that time we are inſtructed by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to expect the things here mentioned: God and Chriſt attended by the Angels, and the Church of the Firſt Born, conſiſting of Juſt Men, made perfect, both in their Spirits, and in their Bodies, to the City of God, or the New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, which St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>Shall come down from God out of Heaven, as a Bride adorned for her Husband, at, or after the time of the Reſurrection; after Heaven and Earth have been ſhaken, and are removed.</hi> This I conceive to be the Time pointed at in this Text; and I think theſe Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not applicable to any other Time, nor hath Mr. <hi>W.</hi> mentioned any other Time for their Accompliſhment, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that at Mens Death, and for which he hath no Warrant from any words of this Text; and as to the words in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>Ye are come to theſe Glories;</hi> I think they are moſt apt to intend, A coming to them by Faith, whilſt we are in this World: Such a Faith, as is the Evidence of things not ſeen; but we have direction to hold faſt our Hope and Expectation of them until the End, when we may look for a Crown, or Crowns of Life, to be then diſtributed to all who love our Lords Second Appearing: And then only (I conceive may we hope to be made Partakers of all that Company and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which in this Text are particularly recited.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi> of theſe Souls, or place where they were ſeen. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In their Habits or manner of Cloathing. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the ſubject matter of their Prayers to God. Their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> or place where <hi>John</hi> ſaw them, was under the Altar; we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.1. <hi>The Altar of Burnt Offerings was to be made five Cubits long and five Cubits broad, which I conceive to be next our meaſure of three Yards ſquare, and three Cubits high, a little more then one Yard and half high.</hi> Verſ. 8. <hi>Hollow with Boards ſhalt thou make it, and thou ſhalt overlay it with Braſs, and thou ſhalt make for it a Net work of Braſs.</hi> If we ſhall but a little conſider the Nature and Darkneſs of ſuch a little Hole as the hollowneſs of this Altar could afford; it ſeems we cannot but ſtand convinced, that Thouſands of Souls caſt or crouded into that dark Priſon, were far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying ſuch a ſtate of Happineſs as Men are commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to aſcribe to them; and therefore Mr. <hi>W.</hi> takes upon him to ſet at Liberty, without any Warrant from the Text for his ſo doing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Habits which the Text ſays were beſtowed on them, ſeems needleſs for Souls, and ſpecially for ſuch Souls as were crouded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that manner. If they were looſe Robes like Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſſes, the Hole under that Altar could hardly contain the Thouſands of ſuch Robes which might happen to be uſed upon that Occaſion; and if they were cloſe Robes and fitted to their Shapes, I doubt it would puzzle all our Taylors; and the large Invention of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> to find out Ways and Means of fitting our Souls with ſuch Robes as might rightly be accommodated to the Shapes of ſuch Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſubject matter of the Prayers which theſe Souls offer'd to God, ſeems very different from, and ſomewhat oppoſite to the tenor of the Goſpel. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44. Our Lord in his large Sermon on the Mount, ſays, <hi>Love
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107192:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>your Enemies, Bleſs them that Curſe you, do Good to them that Hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.12. <hi>Being Reviled we ſuffer it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſecuted we bleſs;</hi> and we find that what our Lord and his Diſciples taught in this Point, they practiſed: Our Lord at his departure pray'd for his Perſecutors, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do;</hi> and St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> in like manner, at the time of his Death, prayed, <hi>Lord lay not this Sin to their Charge.</hi> So as it ſeems, this crying with loud Voices to God for Vengeance on their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, was contrary both to the Doctrine and Practice of the Goſpel; whence we may reaſonably conjecture, that the things related in this Text were not Real, but Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical or Typical, repreſenting or ſhadowing ſuch things as ſhould be made known by that Propheſie; for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring whereof I think fit to produce another Expoſition which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has before given us. He ſays, <hi>That by Souls in this Text, we muſt underſtand dead Carcaſſes to be meant.</hi> I ſay, <hi>We muſt underſtand dead Perſons to be meant, it being very uſual in Scripture to intend or ſignifie Perſons by the Name or Term of Souls; as when</hi> Jacob <hi>went down into</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>the Perſons of his Family are termed ſo many Souls, and in St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Voyage to</hi> Italy, <hi>there were in the Ship that carryed him</hi> 276 <hi>Souls, which in this place are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd;</hi> 40 <hi>by the Terms</hi>

                     <hi>and in our quoted Text by the ſame Term</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>I ſaw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar the Souls of the Martyrs:</hi> And hence I inſiſt, that the ſame Term or word of Souls, which intends Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voyage, may very likely intend Perſons in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion, and thence put into proper Terms, it may be read, I ſay under the Altar, the Perſons of them that were ſlain for the word of God. And if this Senſe may be accepted, and the whole Viſion taken for Typical, the three fore-named Differences or Difficulties will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reconciled and made ſtand together. To the firſt I
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107192:69"/>ſay, That by theſe Perſons being under the Altar, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Typified, the State of thoſe ſlain Perſons, and the Care which God had of them; they were as ſafe in their Beings, as if they had been lodged under guard of the Altar of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nt Offerings; and were as near to God, and as much under his Care and Protection, as if they had lain in the Court of his Sanctuary, and under the Shadow and Covert of his Holy Altar. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The white Robes which were given to each of them, ſeem to Typifie (as St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth it) the Righteouſneſs of Saints, and the Innocence of their Lives upon Earth; their Works having been waſhed and made clean with the Blood of the Lamb; and as often as theſe came in remembrance before God, the Perſons might be ſaid to receive white Robes, every time that ſuch Remembrance of them was renewed, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſequent thereunto Conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> their Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Salvation at the General Day of Judgment. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Concerning the Prayers or Cries of theſe Souls for Vengeance upon their Perſecutors: Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and I, are hotb agreed, that they made no other Cry in this Text, then the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> made to God for Vengeance on his Murtherer; and I conceive there was no real Prayer or Cry in either of theſe Caſes, but that God himſelf had taken ſpecial Notice in both theſe Caſes, and that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they came before him hy Remembrance or any ſort of Re-preſentation, his Intention always continued firm to take Vengeance for thoſe Facts, upon all thoſe who had therein acted, and continued in ſuch wicked Practices (without Saving Repentance) until the time of their Deaths.</p>
                  <p>I have Inclinations to think that this Expoſition of our proving Text, is more ſound and true than that which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath before made of it; and hence I think the Conſequence will be very clear, That Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Argument
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107192:69"/>drawn from this Text, is not a ſufficient nor a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove the Separate Subſiſtence of Souls.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 119. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>By Bleſſedneſs in this Text, muſt needs be meant Happineſs, and all Happineſs implies Joy, and all Joy implies Life; and when he has rais'd Bleſſedneſs in this manner, he infers from the Word henceforth, that it muſt Commence preſently upon the death of the Perſon; wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſignification of the Words, from Henceforth, which do properly ſignifie (from the time of that Propheſie, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) the time of every Man's Death, which I do not find to be mentioned or intended by the Text:</hi> And he adds, The meaning of the Text being thus opened, he ſeems to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his following Diſcourſe, only to thoſe who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the true Senſe of the Text to be as he hath opened it; and to them he thus argues: <hi>If the Dead in the Lord do from the time of their being dead, commence a Bleſſedneſs, not only in reſting from their Labours, but likewiſe in being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for their Works, then do they continue to live in ſome part of them, which is their Spirits, and conſequently their Spirits die not with their Bodies, but are Immortal.</hi>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 120. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> offers to us, <hi>That this Bleſſedneſs is ſaid by the Spirit to be given from the time of Mens Deaths,</hi> this he collects from the ſignification of the Words <hi>from Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth;</hi> as if that intended from the time of their Death's, whereas it appears in this Text to intend no more, but that from the time of this Propheſie; <hi>the Dead which die in the Lord, ſhall have a bleſſed Reſt; and their Works do follow them.</hi>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 121. Then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pretends, <hi>That the dead Saints do not only enjoy a bleſſed Reſt, but that they alſo enter upon, and enjoy Rewards for their Works, as ſoon as they are dead;</hi> but I find no Ground for this Opinion in the Text, but conceive he thought it was there, becauſe he had a great Mind it ſhould be there, as a thing that would have done him more Service than any thing that he can find in the Text beſides.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays further, <hi>If no Rewards of active Happineſs and Joy followed immediately after Death, it would be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful the Spirit of God ſhould pronounce a Bleſſedneſs on ſuch as die in the Lord, above thoſe who live on Earth in the Lord; and this would be contrary to the Senſe of all God's People, and ſpecially to the Senſe of ſuch as Adminiſter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to dying Perſons from this Topick, by telling them, that immediately after Death their Souls ſhall by Angels be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into Heaven, or Paradiſe, or Abraham's Boſome, or ſome ſuch Place, where they ſhall not only be at reſt, but have preſent Joys and Happineſs conferr'd upon them;</hi> and I grant that if ſuch Doctrine prove otherwiſe than true, many Perſons may have been deceived of their confident Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and more may ſtill in future happen ſo to be. And therefore I think it needful to take further Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo make a ſtricter Scrutiny concerning the Truth of this Doctrine, than in former Times and Ages hath been commonly done amongſt Men. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>He thinks there are none of God's People, who would not rather chuſe to live upon Earth tho' under Perſecution, then to die and be buried in the Earth;</hi> He ſays it is evident, <hi>That from the time of dying, the Saints are bleſſed with Rewards for their Work, as well as from their Labour.</hi> I reply, I am very ſorry that I am not able to find in this Text an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, (or any of his former) the thing which he ſays is ſo evident; intending I preſume to himſelf, and ſome ſuch other Perſons as may be ſtrongly fixed in his Opinion and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107192:70"/>Belief touching this Point, concerning which; and this Text, I intend to make a little more large Examination. The Words therefore are, <hi>And I heard a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying unto me write, Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi> I do not find in this Text any Words which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie or import that Men ſhall be rewarded for their Works preſently after Death, otherwiſe than by a Bleſſed Reſt from their Labours. It is ſaid indeed, <hi>That their Works do follow them,</hi> but there is no time mention'd when they ſhall overtake them: And I deſire Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Party, from henceforth, that they will ceaſe from perverting the Senſe of the Word from <hi>Henceforth</hi> in this Text, by applying its Energy to the time of Mens Deaths, whereas in the words of our Text, it ſtands clearly apply'd to the time when this Propheſie was revealed to St. <hi>John;</hi> and whereas Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That none of Gods Saints upon Earth would willingly embrace Death, but rather chuſe a longer Life upon Earth, (altho' under a ſtate of great Perſecution) if they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Heavenly Rewards preſently upon the death of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> and he ſays, <hi>You ſhall never perſwade People to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented departure out of this World, by telling them they ſhall preſently enjoy a bleſſed Reſt in the Lord, and therefore they muſt be told of, and perſwaded to expect Glorious Rewards in Heaven preſently after their paſſing out of this World.</hi> I confeſs thereupon, that Mens miſtakes upon this Account may be very great, and very univerſal, but do by no means believe the firſt part of his Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are no Saints or People upon Earth, who are willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Death, whenſoever God ſhall appoint it to come upon them, under a great contentment of Mind, and the Satisfaction which they may receive from this Text, <hi>That they ſhall have a bleſſed Reſt in the Lord,</hi> ſafe from all the Temptations and Tribulations of this World, and from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107192:71"/>the Power and Malice of wicked Men and Spirits; expecting thereby to be delivered from Pains and Sickneſſes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Oppreſſion, Impriſonments, Baniſhments, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Miſeries, which during this Life may be inflicted upon them by outward and inward Maladies and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and then alſo to be ſet at Liberty, and made free from all Temptations, Allurements, and Provocations to Sin; which by the World, and the wicked Men and Spirits of it, may be offered to them. And Laſtly, from the wicked Inclinations of their own Hearts, and the traiterous and deceitful Dealing which they too often find therein; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them by ſtrong Inclinations to proſecute that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,</hi> or exceſs of their Affections and Luſts, to which all Mankind are ſtrongly inclin'd by the bent of that Nature which I think God planted in them at the very Creation of our firſt Parents; to ſuch Ends and Purpoſes as are beſt known to his Godly Wiſdom. That ſome of the beſt of God's Servants have deſired Death for the very Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Worldly Troubles and Sufferings, may thus be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.15. <hi>Moſes</hi> was very highly grieved with the bitter Complaints that the <hi>Jews</hi> made againſt him, for bringing them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into a Barren and Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Wilderneſs, and expoſtulates thereupon with God, That the Burthen of providing for all this People was too heavy for him, ſo as he was not able to bear it; and thereupon ſays to God, <hi>If thou deal thus with me, kill me I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy ſight, and let me not ſee my Wretchedneſs.</hi> 1 Kings 19.4. <hi>The Prophet</hi> Elijah <hi>received a Meſſage from</hi> Jezebel, <hi>that he ſhould the next day be ſlain; upon which Meſſage he fled for ſafety of his Life into the Wilderneſs of</hi> Judah, <hi>and there ſat him down under a</hi> Juniper-Tree, <hi>and requeſted of God for himſelf that he might die; and ſaid, it is enough now, O Lord, take away my Life, for I am not better than my Fathers.</hi> Job 3.11. Job's Sufferings are famous in the World, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107192:71"/>need not be ſpecified, and this Text and Chapter eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the great deſire he had to obtain a ſpeedy Death, as the great Remedy for all his Sufferings; <hi>He wiſhes to have died from the Womb,</hi> for then ſays he, <hi>ſhould I now have lain ſtill and been at quiet, I ſhould have ſlept; then had I been at reſt with Lords and Princes, or as a hidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Birth; for the Great and Small are there: there the wicked ceaſe from Troubling, there the weary be at reſt; wherefore is Life given to him that is in miſery and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Soul, which long for Death but it cometh not, and dig for it more than for hidden Treaſure? which rejoyce exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and are glad when they can find the Grave.</hi> By theſe and the like Inſtances, we may perceive that Death, as a ſtate of Reſt, is preferred by the beſt among Men, before a ſtate of Life ſubject to great Sufferings in this World, and we find it not only to be deſired by Men, but to be promis'd and given by God, with intent to prevent ſuch worldly ſufferings, as would fall upon his Favourites if they ſhould continue to live longer in the World. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.1. <hi>The Righteous periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and no Man layeth it to Heart, and merciful Men are taken away, none conſidering that the Righteous is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Evil to come.

Abijah <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>was ſick,</hi> and God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth by his Prophet that he ſhall die, and that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in Peace ſhall Die, be Buryed, and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; becauſe in him there is found ſome good thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> After which a lamentable Affliction ſhould fall upon the whole Houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> no other Perſon whereof ſhould come to the Grave in Peace. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20. <hi>Joſiah</hi> received this Meſſage from <hi>Hul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> the Propheteſs, that God would bring great Miſeries and utter Deſtruction upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation of thoſe times; but that becauſe he was in God's Favour, <hi>God will
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107192:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>gather thee unto thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered into thy Grave in Peace, and thy Eyes ſhall not ſee all the Evil which I will bring upon this Place:</hi> whence it ſeems, God by his Death did intend him the Benefit of being delivered by Death, from the greateſt Sufferings and Calamities which were intended to fall upon his Kingdom, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this time; and which accordingly took Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Death. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>To me to live is Chriſt, and to die is Gain, and I have a deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and be with Chriſt which is far better; yet my living in the Fleſh is more needful for you:</hi> and this put him in a ſtrait which to chuſe, Death he knew was better for him, but his Life might be more helpful to them: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Death was better for him, ſeems to have riſen from the Troubles, Wants, and other Afflictions, which he ſuffer'd in the World, and yet had great aſſurance of a Bleſſed Reſt in the Grave, and that there was laid up for him a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which God the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge would give him at that Day, and not to him only, but to all thoſe that love Chriſt's appearing, [and wait for his ſecond coming] and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> prays for one <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> that he may find Mercy of God in that day: And ſo <hi>John</hi> 6. Our Lord repeats it four times, <hi>That thoſe who ſerve him, ſhall be rais'd up [to a ſtate of Happineſs] at the laſt Day;</hi> whence thoſe who die in ſuch a State or Condition, are freed from the Labour of working out their own Salvation, <hi>with Fear and Trembling;</hi> and ſuch as now think they ſtand from the Fear and Danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: And for theſe Reaſons, <hi>to die and to be with Chriſt, in the Senſe of reſting or ſleeping in him, is better and more eligible than to live in Chriſt in the World, and ſpecially in an afflicted and ſuffering Condition.</hi> And, conclude from my Argument before rehearſed, that the Eighteenth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is not a ſufficient nor a good Argument to prove the Souls Separate Subſiſtence.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 122. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> farther quotes, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.25. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles appointed two perſons of their Company, and caſt Lots upon, to decide which of them ſhould be put into the Rank of the other Eleven Apoſtles; and thereupon they prayed to God and ſaid, Thou Lord which knoweth the Hearts of all Men, ſhew whether of theſe thou paſt choſen; <hi>That he may take part of this Miniſtry and Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, from which</hi> Judas <hi>by Tranſgreſſion fell, that he might go to his own place. And they gave forth thiir Lots, and the Lot fell upon</hi> Matthias, <hi>and he was numbred with the Eleven Apoſtles.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> applies the Words, <hi>that he might go to his own Place, unto the Perſon of</hi> Judas, which he ſays, <hi>intends into Hell, and not only into the Grave, becauſe every Man goes thither as well as he.</hi> I anſwer, That if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> think truly an infinite number of other Perſons go to Hell as well as <hi>Judas,</hi> and therefore Hell is no more the proper place of <hi>Judas</hi> than the Grave may be. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> I ſay, That altho' the Grave be a place of Reſt and Bleſſedneſs to thoſe that die in the Lord, yet to thoſe who die in a ſtate of Enmity with him, the Approaches of Death ſeem terrible, and the Grave is not a ſufficient ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, from the wrath of God and of the Lamb, when Chriſt ſhall come to give Judgment upon the quick and dead. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It ſeems the very words of the Text, do naturally require a different Conſtruction from that which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath put upon them, by applying the words, might go to his own Place, unto the Perſon then to be choſen, who might with aſſurance go to his own Place of a Twelfth Apoſtle, into which by Lot he ſhould then be choſen; and <hi>Matthias</hi> we read did go to his own place, and was numbred with the other Eleven Apoſtles. I do not know whether Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> apply the words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner or not, but if he do, I think he is in the right of it, and give my Conſent thereunto. And thus it ſeems to me, no reaſonable Argument can hence be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107192:73"/>drawn to prove the Souls Separate Subſiſtence. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> for further proof of his Opinion, quotes <hi>Jude</hi> 7. <hi>Even as</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and the Cities about them, in like manner, giving themſelves over to Fornication,</hi> are ſet forth for an Example, ſuffering the Vengeance of Eternal Fire. Hereupon Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>This Text intends the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Sodomites Souls after Death:</hi> I anſwer, that to thoſe who already believe there are Souls ſo ſuffering, Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s. Senſe of the Words may be well enough admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but to thoſe who ſtand unconvinc'd of Mens Souls ſuffering ſoon after their Deaths, this ſaying ſeems to have no ſtrength of Proof in it; for they will expound it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, and ſay, that for the wickedneſs of the People, thoſe Cities, and the whole plain of <hi>Sodom</hi> do ſuffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire; they did ſo at the time of that Deſtruction, and they do ſo ſtill, and are likely ſo to continue to the end of the World, turn'd into a Sulphureous and Bitumenous Lake, the matter whereof is apt to take Fire upon all occaſions; and as to the word Eternal, we find it in Scripture divers times uſed, to ſignifie things of a very long Continuance; as the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Royalty of <hi>David,</hi> the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> their being eſtabliſh'd for ever: And yet we have ſeen them all deſtroy'd long ago. And hence I infer, that no good Argument can be taken from his laſt quoted Text, for proof of the Souls Separate Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>With this Quotation Mr. <hi>W.</hi> cloſes Eighteen or Twenty Arguments for proof of the Souls Separate Subſiſtence, to each of which I have given a diſtinct Anſwer, and ſuch as doth very well ſatisfie my own Underſtanding, with ſubmiſſion therein to the judgment of ſuch intelligent Perſons as may happen to peruſe both our Endeavours, for the proof and diſproving of our Apprehenſions in this Queſtion.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 123. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here proceeds in his endeavour to main tain the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, by inferring abſurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences from the other Opinion of the Souls extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Death of the Perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 123. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> thinks it an abſurd Belief, that Men ſhould ſuffer for their Sins no more than Temporal Death; but ſays, <hi>If his Soul have not a Seperate Subſiſtence, he can ſuffer no more than a Temporal Death, except we had Ground to believe a Reſurrection of the Body, of which the Scripture is ſilent, and we likewiſe deny it.</hi> I ſay to this, that I do not therein apprehend his Meaning: I cannot believe that he intended to deny the Reſurrection of the Dead, which I offer as a full Anſwer to his pretended Abſurdity; and tho' in words he denies it, yet I cannot conceive his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 124. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays ſecondly the ſame things which he ſaid before in his firſt, and muſt have the ſame Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Reſurrection of the Perſon removes and and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all this ſecond pretended Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 125. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Beaſts are Sick, and Groan and Die for Man's Sin or Sinfulneſs;</hi> I reply, That I cannot grant him this; conceiving, that if Man had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet the Beaſts ſhould have been ſick, and groaned and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well and as much as they do now; and the Doctrine of the Reſurrection is a full Anſwer to this pretended Abſurdity.</p>
                  <p>His Fourth pretended Abſurdity is to be anſwer'd after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>His pretended Fifth Abſurdity is anſwer'd by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as before is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 126. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That without a Revelation from God, concerning the Reſurrection of the whole Man, Men could not expect the Rewards or Puniſhments after Death, unleſs their Souls have a Seperate Subſiſtence;</hi> and this I am ready to agree to him, and if there be no Reſurrection, I do alſo agree, that Men have been very much deceived in their Expectation of Recompences after this Life; and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107192:74"/>that upon the ſuppoſal of no Reſurrection, they have been Wiſer who indulg'd themſelves in their Pleaſures, than thoſe who have reſtrained their Appetites, in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Recompences expected after this Life. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If in this Life only we have hope in Chriſt, we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are of all Men moſt miſerable;</hi> but the Dead ſhall riſe as certainly as Chriſt was rais'd, and if theſe Reſurrections of Chriſt and the Dead be not both true, then all Chriſtian Religion is Vain, and all thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are Periſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 127. He ſays, <hi>If the Heathens had no reaſon to believe the Immortality of the Soul, and had no Revelation at all of a Reſurrection given them;</hi> how then ſays Mr. <hi>W. Could they be brought to a Reformation in their Manners?</hi> I put the Queſtion concerning the Goſpel of Chriſt; If there be no Name given under Heaven by which Men can be ſaved, but that of Jeſus Chriſt, and the vaſteſt numbers of Men in the World never heard of that Name, and other vaſt Numbers who have heard of it, do not yet believe it, nor have the Faith propounded to them in ſuch manner as they have reaſon to believe it; I may demand of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> what ſhall become of all theſe People? as well as he demands of me, <hi>How Men ſhould order themſelves, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the Reſurrection revealed to them?</hi> And I think, that in both theſe Caſes alike, Men muſt order their Works according to the beſt of their Knowledge, and God will make ſuch Allowances to them, as their Caſes may require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 127. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pretends to perſwade Men, That the World hath been kept in Awe, by pretence of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence after this Life; whereas the Scripture tells us, the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> under the Moſaical Law, were more practically good, and had fewer great Faults among them, when they had lived under the Diſcipline of Earthly Rewards and Puniſhments, than they had in ſucceeding and later Ages, when the Opinion of the Souls Immortality began to be received and ſpread amongſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107192:74"/>them; and therefore it ſeems there is not that need of his Opinion concerning the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence as he by this Diſcourſe pretends to make Men believe.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s ſecond Chain of Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 128. He ſays, <hi>His Oppoſers pretends the Spirit of Life in Man or his Soul, to be but a fine Temperament of Moiſture, Air and Fire, very near of Kin, and ſutable to the Temperament of the Body:</hi> and this he ſays, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their Principles; and I agree, that what he ſays is true in this Point. This Mr. <hi>W.</hi> oppoſes; by ſaying Firſt, <hi>If things were ſo, then</hi> Adam's <hi>Soul might have been crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Dust as well as his Body.</hi> I reply, not ſo, but there was required Moiſture, Air and Fire, to ſuppie and actuate that Duſt of which his Body was framed, which brought the ſteems of Life in the Body to ſuch a ripeneſs and pullulation, as by the breathing a Breath of Life into him, became inſtantly inflamed; and by Reſpiration muſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moment be fanned by that Breath which continues in Man's Blood and Humours, and the Spirits thereof that flame and glowing, whoſe total Extinguiſhment is the death of the Perſon; and this by want of Reſpiration become inſtantly ſuffocated and extinguiſhed, which (as hath been ſaid) is the death of the Perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 129. He ſays, <hi>He hath opened in his firſt Argument what this breathing into Man intends, and refers his Readers thither again for the Knowledge of it;</hi> and I refer again unto the Anſwer thereunto given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſays, <hi>That ſuch a Soul as his Oppoſers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is ſubject in its parts to Diviſion, Diſſipation, and Corruption;</hi> which I agree to him. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That from thence it will follow, that all God's Threats denounced againſt Sinners, is but to keep thoſe inflam'd Particles of the Blood in order;</hi> but I ſay, Thoſe Threats are pronounced to keep Mens Perſons and their Actions in ſuch a regular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that the Reports and Belief of the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107192:75"/>are effectual upon the Perſons of Men, whoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will then be as able to indure the Fire as their Souls.</p>
                  <p>Another. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That ſuch a Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Soul cannot offend God, becauſe it is Material and Senſeleſs;</hi> and this I agree to him: and ſay, That it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Body nor the Soul ſingly, that doth or can offend God, but it is the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of theſe made Intelligent, or the Perſon made Intelligent, which can and doth too often offend God; and by Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Pretence in this place, he ſeems to inſinuate, <hi>That God cannot produce Intelligence, by his wiſe Commixture of Material Agents and Patients, which hath before been diſputed;</hi> and I have declared my ſelf thereupon, that God can produce Intelligence by a moſt Wiſe and Artificial commixture of Material Agents and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents acted by Motion, which muſt be continually ſupplied from Nutriment, which God out of the ambient World and Air hath continually produced in abundance for that purpoſe; and when by Famine or want of Nutriment it draws no ſupplies, the Perſons who ſuffer it die in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 130. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> repeats, <hi>That our ſort of Material Soul cannot love or fear God, nor understand what it ſelf doth:</hi> which is a thing which I have all along granted and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as I do here; agreeing that ſuch things are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant either with the Soul or Body, but with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 131. He pretends that there is ſomething in Man that is the principal Seat of Regeneration. This I oppoſe, by ſaying as before, That the whole Man or Perſon is ſo, and not only part of his <hi>Compoſitum</hi> ſingly taken: What he ſays more, flows out of the abundance of his own Heart, and ſeems (to me) to be very groundleſly ſpoken. Fifthly, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Contentions between the Fleſh and Spirit in Man, cannot be maintained by the Natural dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a Material Soul, and the Body wherein it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides;</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:107192:75"/>I agree this to him, Anſwering, That all theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts between the Fleſh and Spirit, ſignifie no more than that continual War which Men feel in themſelves, between the Power of Reaſon in their Minds, and the Luſtful Deſire of their Affections and Paſſions. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, There is no end of this War but Death, and no certainty which ſhall obtain a clear Victory till that time; and when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays that theſe War againſt the Soul, the word Soul muſt there be intended to ſignifie the Perſon, or the good of the whole Man; and yet I do agree what he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſays to be true, That the Rational and Affective Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſpring both from the ſame Root or Compoſition of Mankind, and are both ſupported by the ſame Breath and Nouriſhment, and yet the Faculties themſelves are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and are commonly at ſtrife one with another; and as we daily ſee, Love and Hatred, Joy and Sorrow, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting together in one ſame Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Philoſophical Abſurdities, which he ſays flow from the Opinion of the Souls Materiality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 132. He ſays, <hi>If the Soul be Material, it will follow, that Mens faculties of Reaſon, Intellect and Memory, are ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Corporeal Elementary Subſtance;</hi> but it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſays he, <hi>That none of theſe faculties can be immediately ſeated in any Corporeal Elementary Subſtance;</hi> anſwering, I deny the Evidence of what he ſays, but apply all theſe Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Perſon in which they all certainly are, produced by the wiſdom of God, acted by Motion, and ſupported and continued by Nouriſhment and Breath; and therefore the Spirit of Life in Man may be Material, notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s aſſerting the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 133. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>Theſe Faculties cannot be acted by a Material Subſtance; but he finds theſe Faculties in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore they must be acted in Men by a Spiritual Subſtance.</hi> This ſeems to intend, that when Men cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107192:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>to know the reaſon by which, or the manner how ſtrange things are done, they are apt to fly to the refuge of Spirits for the doing of them; an erroneous courſe which hath been very often uſed in the World: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> the uſe which he pretends to make of it in this Argument, and do aſſure, that I receive no manner of conviction from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 135. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>I find a power in me of Senſation, as Seeing, Hearing,</hi> ctc. <hi>but none of theſe Faculties are ſeated in a Subſtance purely Elementary.</hi> I demand then, how come the Brutes by theſe, which they have in as great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Men have them?</p>
                  <p>He thinks no Man will ſay it is poſſible to make a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Houſe by all the Art that Men can uſe about it; and this I grant: but if Men ſhould ſay it is poſſible for God to make a Senſible Houſe, I ſhould have no Inclinations to deny it; believing that to be altogether as as feaſible, as to make a Camel go through the eye of a Needle. With Men and to their Underſtandings, all ſuch things are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but not with God. I think it impoſſible for the Art or Induſtry of Man to make and give Life to a Mouſe, a Flie, a tuft of Graſs, or a Flower. The Art of the whole World hath never yet been able to produce ſuch Creatures, and to put Life into them; and how then dare ſuch weak Writers compare their Knowledge and Skill with that of the Great Creator, and pretend to ſay, That he who made all things out of nothing, cannot make what he will, out of any Matter which he will make uſe of: and tho' I will not be ſo humorous, as to think it poſſible for Men to make a Senſible Houſe, or any other Senſible or Living Creature whatſoever, yet I am certain, that God hath made an Infinite number of Senſible Creatures, unto whom I think Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will not think fit to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Souls of the ſame ſort with thoſe which he beſtows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:107192:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 135. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> recounts to us divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars concerning the Memory, and ſays that Men are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give an account of the mode or manner of its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I agree Mens Inabilities ſo to do: well but then ſays he, If you cannot tell me the manner of ſuch Actions by the ſpirits of the Blood in the Brain, I wlll conclude it is done by the Power of an Intelligent Spirit. I reply, That if he will do ſo, I cannot help; but I refuſe to bear him Company in that miſtake, unleſs he can give me a better account how his Spirit accounts Memory in the Brain, and after what manner the ſame is performed, than I can give him concerning the Spirits of Blood acting the Brain to that purpoſe. I am ready to confeſs my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the later, and I ſhall think him as Ignorant in the former, until he ſhall give us a better account thereof, then hitherto hath appeared in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 136. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> argues; <hi>That the Soul muſt needs be Immortal, becauſe Men have a Rational Faculty, whereby they can act abundance of things here by him enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, and which ſeem to be beyond all Capacities in the Nature of Matter it ſelf, and all the Advantages which Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art or Induſtry can give it:</hi> To this I Anſwer as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That altho' the nature of Matter be not proper in it ſelf for ſuch Productions, nor can be made to ſerve ſuch purpoſes by the Art or Induſtry of Men; yet the Wiſdom, Skill and Power of God, are able to produce ſuch Effects out of Matter and Motion, as Men are not able rationally to conceive, nor it ſeems by Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Diſcourſe are willing to believe. That he aſcribes all theſe Powers to his ſort of Soul, which are truly in and proper to the Perſon, muſt paſs for his Common Error, and is perhaps incurable in him, becauſe I find it ſo laſting, as to reach from the one end to the other; in refutation whereof, I think there has been enough already ſpoken, and therefore I paſs over much that he hath ſaid in this place to the ſame Purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Immoralities conſequent upon the Doctrine of the Souls Mortality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 139. He ſays, <hi>That it lets Men looſe to Immoralities, and gratifies bad Men and their Actions.</hi> I anſwer, That for the ſpace of Thirteen Years laſt paſt, I have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Opinion to be the more probable of the two, and yet have not found that it had any effect at all upon my Manners or the other Opinions which I before held concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and his Worſhip; and therefore I am not apt to believe that it will have bad effects upon other Perſons, who may likewiſe conceive this Opinion to be the more probable. Next he ſays, This Opinion creates contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thoughts of Mens Souls. I Anſwer, That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the not being of any thing, can breed no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that which Men think hath not a Being, or not ſuch a Being as other Men imagine. I alſo ſay, That thoſe who think their Beings to be compoſed of no other things but Elemementary Matter, may yet juſtly have a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of themſelves; as the Skilful Workmanſhip of God after his own Image, and endued with more excellent Faculties and Powers than any other Animal or Earthly Crateures whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 140. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>Belief of the Souls Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, keeps the minds of wicked Men from fearing the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which others expect to ſucceed the very time of their Deaths.</hi> I Anſwer, That theſe Apprehenſions do more commonly terrifie the Good and Weak, than the Bold and Wicked, both in the time of their Lives, and at the day of their Deaths; and whether it do more good or hurt in theſe Reſpects, I pretend to queſtion. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Doctrine of the Reſurrection and the Laſt Judgment, may be of Conſideration ſufficient to terrifie wicked Perſons;</hi> and yet it ſeems not that he is ſo well ſatisfi'd therewithal as I am, but would have the Belief of the Souls Separate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence ſuper-added thereunto; and I ſhould therewith be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107192:78"/>contented, if the ſame could be any thing near ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the Doctrine of the Reſurrection may be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>The Opinion of the Souls Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment is troubleſome to the Souls of good Men; a mode of ſpeaking which I would correct, and ſay it is troubleſome to good Men themſelves, whoſe Hearts are in Heaven whilſt they are on Earth, to whom it is grievous to think of any delay between Death and their going to God to live in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with him.</hi> I Anſwer, that tho' by Error in their Belief, they may be diſappointed of that expected Happineſs; yet it ſeems they ſhall fare never the worſe for it, nor know how much they were deceived, till the time of the Reſurrection, and then their Works which follow them will be ſure to overtake them, and they will receive no Detriment by that delay, which they may find in their going to God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diſtance between Death and the Reſurrection, is of no conſideration at all to the dead Perſon, who ſhall riſe as if he were then but newly fallen aſleep, and be utterly unknowing and unperceiving what time hath paſſed over him ſince his Death, and whether any time hath paſſed over him at all or not.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath uſed divers high and ſome tragical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt his Oppoſers and their Opinion, in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon this Head, which I paſs over, as not greatly ſignificant in this Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>Ancient Teſtimonies both of the Jews and Primitive Chriſtians, proving the Souls Immortality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 142. Thereupon Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That his ancient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Belief of the Chriſtian Church, is no ſmall Evidence of the Truth of that Opinion.</hi> And I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree this to him, that theſe are great Evidences of the Truth thereof, and I think them the ſtrongeſt Evidences which he hath yet produced; and yet I do not conceive that they have in them a Conviction ſtrong enough to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige all People to a Concurrence in that Opinion, becauſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107192:79"/>all theſe Evidences are reſolvable into an Humane Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon which I have no Inclination to found ſuch a Faith as is the Evidence of things not ſeen, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſuch a Belief as concerning which, there is neither Doubt nor Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> gives us here a long Teſtimony out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> from whence we may collect, that ſome <hi>Jews</hi> held one thing, and ſome another concerning Souls: Some thought of them, that one ſort liv'd in perpetual Priſon after Death, and another ſort roſe very ſhortly; and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>The generality of the</hi> Jews <hi>were of that Mind;</hi> and ſays, <hi>The Sadduces denied the Souls Immortality, and ſhews that</hi> Joſephus <hi>was no Friend of theirs.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes <hi>Joſeph</hi> a Speaker; ſaying, <hi>That Mens Souls go to Heaven, and then after a certain Revolution or Period, are again commanded to live in Bodies.</hi> Another Speaker ſays, <hi>It is Miſery to live, and not to die; for Death freeth our Souls from Priſon, into their moſt pure and proper Place, ſo as whilſt they are in the Body, they may properly be ſaid to be dead;</hi> but this paſſes with me for a Platonick Fable, concerning which enough has been ſpoken. This <hi>Jew</hi> ſays, The Soul comes ſecretly into Men without being perceived, and ſo depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from them again. I reply, <hi>De non apparentibus, &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio.</hi> I ſay alſo, That where ever the Blood paſſes freely in the Body, the Parts and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are freſh and lively; but where Obſtructions hinders the rivage of Blood from paſſing, the Bodily Parts and Members become withered and uſeleſs. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> concludes, <hi>It is clear that the Church of the</hi> Jews <hi>always held the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Souls Immortality,</hi> forgetting the Texts which I have before quoted, which prove the Patriarchal and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Opinion to have been, That the Life of Senſative Creatures lies in their Blood, and other Opinion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Jews hath he quoted none, till that which he ſeems to coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Job</hi> or <hi>David</hi> make any mention of Spiritual Souls; ſo that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Writings are the firſt wherein we find mention of this ſort of Souls of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> In his Third Chapter, he doubts, and in his Twelfth Chapter, he ſays in few Words and Tranſiently, <hi>The Spirit returns to God who gave it;</hi> and there he is ſpeaking of the diſſolution of the humane Perſon; and ſays, <hi>The Body returns to the Duſt as it was,</hi> what became of the Spirit he did not perceive; and therefore contented himſelf to ſay, <hi>The Spirit return'd to God who gave it.</hi> Theſe are all the Arguments Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath collected out of the Old Teſtament; whence I am apt to inferr, that he found no other Text in that Teſtament which made for his purpoſe; but I think fit to mind him of the Hiſtory in the ſecond of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> concerning the Martyrdom of the Seven Brothers by <hi>Antiochus;</hi> there he ſhall find ſeveral of them declaring the Hope they had of being reſtored to their mangled Limbs, at and by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, without mentioning their building of any Hope upon the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence; whence I collect, that Opinion had not yet prevailed amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of thoſe times. It is alſo true, that a Relation of this Martyrdom is ſubjoyned to the Works of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as if it were of his Writing; but I think the very great Verboſity of that Writing proves it to be none of his; but it relates divers Sayings of theſe Brothers, ſhewing the dependance of their Comfort upon the Souls Separate Subſiſtence, and its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate going to Heaven; and this Difference proves to my Underſtanding, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had alter'd their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning their State after Death, between the time of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> Writing, and that wherein <hi>Joſephus</hi> writ his Relation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the ſame be truly of his Writing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 145. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> begins his Quotations of the Ancient Fathers, for proof of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence. I have not the opportunity of examining his Quotations with the Originals, and therefore do not find it reaſonable to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107192:80"/>deny or queſtion the verity of any of them, taking them therefore for veritable, I agree, they give very ſtrong Teſtimony, that thoſe Writings of the Fathers by him quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, prove the Belief of the Writers to have been much conſonant to his Opinion: and I proffer only this Gloſs upon the laſt of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members our Lord went to prepare a place for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, unto which I would add that which follows next after in the Text; <hi>When I have prepared fitting places for you, I will come and receive you to my Self, that where I am ye may be alſo.</hi> This coming of Chriſt, I conceive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his ſecond coming to Judgment; and then, and not till th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, that which our Lord ſays in this Text, may be accompliſhed. It ſeems his words quoted out of <hi>Iraeneus,</hi> do not prove the Souls immediately going to Heaven af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, but to a Paradiſe or place of Pleaſure diſtinct from Heaven; and yet I allow them to be a good Proof that <hi>Iraeneus</hi> by them intends a Belief of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Author which he quotes, he calls the Author of the Reſponſes, <hi>Apud Juſtin.</hi> This I do not think fit to accept as the Opinion of <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For the ſaying of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> he quotes no Author from whence he took it; whence it poſſibly may be taken from <hi>Baroneus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Fourth Quotation out of <hi>Origen</hi> ſeems no ſtrong Proof, becauſe he was a perfect <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> both before and after his Converſion to Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, His Quotation out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch a place for the reception of departed Souls, as is far above the Infernal places, and a place of refreſhment of the Souls of the Juſt, when they are departed out of this Life, where they ſhall abide to the Reſurrection, yet takes it for a different place from Heaven; and I agree, it proves his Agreement to the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:107192:80"/>
                  <p>His Sixth Quotation out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſeems very full to his Purpoſe, that the Martyrs Souls went immediately to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>In his Seventh Quotation concerning the Oration of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> I find no Expreſſion in it that proves ſtrongly for him, ſave that Emperour's diſcourſing concerning the Souls Immortality; upon which I think he might very well diſpute, without making any certain Concluſion thereupon.</p>
                  <p>His Eighth Quotation out of <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> ſeems to me partly Platonick.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, What <hi>Prudentius</hi> ſays, ſeems but to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> in Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi> who calls the Body and this Life the Priſon of the Soul, follows therein the Platonick Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 152. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>He has thus given us the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Primitive Church, for the Four firſt Centuries of it, which is no ſmall Argument of the Truth of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; and of the ſame Opinion have the Chriſtian Churches continued throughout the World: and therefore Men muſt have very ſtrong Arguments if they hope to prevail in rejecting this Opinion.</hi> I anſwer, and grant that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is good and ſtrong for the proving of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſeems to be of more Power and Strength than all that he hath ſaid before for the maintaining of it; but yet I do not perceive that Strength in it which may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupport his Tenet againſt thoſe Reaſons and thoſe Scriptures which may be brought againſt the Rationality and Truth of it; and of which I intend to make a ſhort detail when I come to his following Head, where he makes and delivers Objections againſt his own Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 152. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> begins to relate certain Sayings or Speeches of Reformed Martyrs, who it ſeems died in the Opinion of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence; which may be admitted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107192:81"/>to add ſome ſmall Strength to his former Arguments drawn from the Opinion of the more Ancient Fathers. I do not find it ſtrange that Men ſhould retain to the end of their Days divers Opinions which they had before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed in their Youth, and by their Education hath been radicated in them; eſpecially ſuch as do not appear to have an evil effect upon their Practices. And I think that divers Learned Men, of moſt high Eſteem, even in the Primitive and Apoſtolical Churches, have delivered ſome Doctrines to their Diſciples, which upon ſtrict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be found inconſonant to the ſtream or current of Scripture, and the natural reaſon of Mankind; which Doctrines I conceive the Writers of them did believe to be true, upon the ground of ſuch Tradition as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and which by Education and Cuſtom had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an abſolute aſſent of their Minds in ſuch Caſes. And tho' I ſhall here name only the Millenary Opinion, yet if I thought fit here to digreſs, to that purpoſe, I could add divers other particulars thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 153. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> proceeds to make farther Proof of his Opinion by ſome Repreſentations in Dreams, and others in Shades or Shadows of Perſons departed, unto which I have in a former Treatiſe made Anſwer, that I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there may be verity in divers of thoſe Relations, and yet I do not conceive any thing of that kind hath ever been performed by departed Souls; thinking it probable that there are no ſuch Beings in the World: but I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to aſcribe ſuch Actions to the Powers and Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of inferiour Spirits, without pretending to determine whether good or bad; and that they <hi>juſſu aut permiſſu ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorum,</hi> do repreſent and act according as the occaſions wherein they are imploy'd may require.</p>
                  <p>P. 158. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> produces divers Objections, which he ſays, are made againſt the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to the Number of Fourteen, divers of which I
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107192:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>a gree not to be very material, and tho' I intend to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion each of them, that I may not ſeem to diſregard any thing that he hath Written, yet very little ſhall be ſaid concerning them; my Deſign being only to inſiſt upon thoſe which I think material, and to add unto them ſuch other Objections as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Catalogue hath omitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 158. Mr <hi>W</hi>'s firſt Objection ſays, <hi>That what of the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>it was that ſinned, that of</hi> Adam <hi>died, but both the Soul and Body died, therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this he Anſwers, That he muſt not take Life and Death here in their proper Senſe, but that the word Death here, only intends a miſerable Life; which, however he doth not deny to be Life, and I do not conceive how Death and Life can ſtand together in the ſame ſubject; and therefore I think his Deſcription of Death by a miſerable Life, is not reaſonable nor allowable in this Caſe; concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it agreeable to Reaſon, that the Curſe pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin ſhould extend to the Perſon that ſinned; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Perſons which ſinned did both die for it, or after it, without any appearance of leaving Souls to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive after the Death of their Perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 159. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> will not agree, that their Souls did die as well as their Bodies; becauſe God ſays, <hi>That Duſt thou art, and to Duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> Then he aſſumes the Soul was not made of Duſt, which is a thing before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted between us: I pretending there was no ſuch Soul made as he ſays there was; I ſay my ſort of Soul is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and may return to the Duſt and Air as it was, which he will deny, and thereupon we muſt examine all that has been ſpoken, which neither of us can deſign to do in this place, but leave this Objection to be farther diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s ſecond Objection from <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. where <hi>Solomon</hi> compares Men with Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 161. He pretends that Text ſays, <hi>The Spirit of Man goes upward, and the Spirit of a Beaſt downward,</hi> which I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107192:82"/>think it doth not ſay, but makes a doubt whether the truth of the thing be ſo or no; it ſeems <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately concerning Mens Souls in this Text, than he does in his Twelfth Chapter, and yet I paſs this Objection light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over, without laying any great weight upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 162. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> raiſes a third Objection from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. where our Lord ſays, <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto Death;</hi> from whence ſome Men may pretend to inferr, that his Soul might die; I profeſs to be none of thoſe who make this Objection; for I conceive that Chriſt by the word Soul, intended his Perſon or himſelf, in the ſame Senſe as if he had ſaid, I am ſorrowful unto Death, and therefore I paſs this over as a weak Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 164. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> raiſes a fourth Objection againſt himſelf, from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nor ſuffer thy Holy one to ſee Corruption.</hi> Here, he ſays, ſome will have Chriſt's Intellectual Soul to be meant, and by Hell or <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or the Grave, without intention to ſpeak of an Intellectual Soul, or any other Soul at all; and therefore I paſs this over as a very light Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 169. The fifth Objection which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Opinion, is raiſed from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>being cloathed upon with his Houſe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> I have ſaid before that this Expreſſion reſpects that Tranſlation of their Bodies, which the Saints who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live upon Earth at Chriſt's coming ſhall receive, when they ſhall be diſrobed of their Earthly Bodies, and have them chang'd into Heavenly or Spiritual Bodies; and yet I do not find any great Strength in this Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, but paſs it away as a very weak one, without ſaying any more to it.</p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:107192:82"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 171. Sixthly, He objects againſt his own Opinion, that the Scriptures make frequent mention of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be given at the day of Judgment, but make no mention of ſuch Recompences to be given ſoon after Death, or between that and the Reſurrection. This I own to be a very ſtrong Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, and do intend to make it one of mine, which I mean to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at the end of his Catalogue of Objections, and there further to conſider his Anſwer to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 172. Seventhly, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> objects againſt himſelf, If the Souls of Men paſs their Tryal as ſoon as their Bodies are dead, what needs any other Day of Judgment? will Chriſt try Men after Sentence? This I think to be a ſtrong Objection, and therefore I mean to repeat it again, and there to conſider his Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 175. Eighthly, He objects againſt himſelf, <hi>When Chriſt which is our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 177. A Ninth Objection which he raiſes againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Glory.</hi> This I think to be a ſtrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, fit to be again repeated, and there his Anſwer ſhall be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 179. His Tenth Objection is taken from King <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s Prayer, in <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> This I think to be ſtrong, and therefore to be repeated, and his Anſwer to be there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 181. His Eleventh Objection from <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.5. <hi>The Dead know not any thing,</hi> ſeems ſtrong, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be repeated, and his Anſwer there conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 182. Twelfthly, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> objects againſt himſelf, the words of <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Save me, leaſt my Enemy tear my Soul like a Lyon.</hi> Here I think is the ſame intent
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107192:83"/>as if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>leaſt he tear me in pieces like a Lyon,</hi> putting here the word Soul to ſignifie Perſon. Therefore I think this Objection to be very weak, and as ſuch I leave it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 183. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> takes his Thirteenth Objection from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. <hi>If the Dead riſe not, then they alſo that are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> This Text and Chapter makes a very ſtrong Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, and therefore it ſhall be hereafter repeated, and his Anſwer there conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 187. Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Fourteenth Objection is raiſed from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>God only hath Immortality dwelling in Light;</hi> I think this to be a very weak Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, and therefore I paſs it over without any further Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>In this Examination of Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Fourteen Objections, we have found one half, or ſeven of them to be of ſmall force for the overthrowing Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion; and I obſerve, that in his propounding divers of the other ſeven which are ſtrong againſt him, he doth it in ſuch manner as their ſtrength ſeems to be much impaired by his manner of delivering them; and therefore I deſign to frame ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeries of Objections againſt his Opinion and to place amongſt them: The Seventh Objection of Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s which I approve, and to conſider therein the Anſwers which he hath given to them, not yet meaning to follow Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s order of propounding them, but I intend to offer all my Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken from Scripture according to the ſeveral times wherein they were delivered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I object againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Fleſh with the Life thereof, which is the Blood thereof, ſhall you not eat; and ſurely your Blood of your Lives will I require, at the Hand of every Beaſt will I require it; and at the hand of Man, at the Hand of every Man's Brother will I require the Life of Man; who ſo ſheddeth Man's Blood,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107192:83"/>by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed; for in the Image of God made he Man.</hi> It ſeems to appear from the words of this Text, that the Terms Blood and Life, have a convercibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity one with another; ſo as no Blood no Life, and the ſhedding of Man's Blood is the killing of him, and it is therefore made a Crime of the higheſt Nature, becauſe the ſhedding of Man's Blood deſtroys the Image of God wherein Man was made. Whence, I conceive Man to be God's Image in his whole Perſon, whoſe Blood may be ſhed, and not only in a particular part of him, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> maintains muſt be his Soul. The words of the Text ſay, <hi>That the Blood of the Creature is the Life thereof;</hi> and Experiences convinces, that all things that have Life have a ſort of Spirit for the maintaining thereof; as Graſs, Herbs, Plants, Trees, Inſects, Fiſhes, Fowls, Brutes, and Men. In Plants or Trees, if we pare off the Skin or Bark, and thereby ſtop the aſcent of the Sap, which is the Spirit of Life in Plants, the Plant will die from that place upwards, becauſe this Sap or Spirit of Life will be obſtructed in its aſcent to the higher parts of the Plant; and among Brutes or Men, if the paſſage of the Blood be obſtructed, thoſe parts to which the Blood cannot come with Freedom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, wither, and become of little or no uſe to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Text ſays, <hi>Fleſh with the Life thereof, which is the Blood thereof;</hi> and Experience ſhews, that the Life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hales with the Blood, ſo as no Blood no Life: Whence I collect, the Spirit of Life in Brutes and men conſiſts and reſides in the Blood, and the inflamed and glowing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits thereof; and thence it ſeems, that as the Spirit of Life in Plants is the Sap thereof, ſo the Spirit of Life in Animals is the Blood kindled and glowing, and the inflamed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles thereof; and ſo our Text ſays, <hi>Fleſh with the Life thereof, which is the Blood thereof:</hi> And from the Premiſſes I argue, that the Spirit of Life in Man is in his Blood, and the inflam'd particles of it; and Experience evidences, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107192:84"/>by like Blood and Spirits, the Brutes are acted both in their Local and Periſtaltick Motions; their Senſes of Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Seeing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Affections of Luſt, Wrath, and Fear, and thoſe degrees which they have of Phantaſie, Choice and Memory. And I pretend hence to infer, that if in the Blood there be a Spirit of Life, which can act the Brutes in their Motions, Senſations and Paſſions, to as high a Degree as Men are acted in thoſe performances, and can act them to lower Degrees of Fancy, Choice and Memory; it ſeems a like Spirit may probably act humane Perſons in all theſe Faculties, and to much higher Degrees in thoſe of Judgment, Phantaſie and Memory, becauſe in ſuch Perſons theſe Spirits meet with Organs of greater perfection, and better fitted for the performance thereof. And hereunto I apply the injecting of Brutal Blood into a Humane Body, which Experience proves will act that Body in ſuch manner, as it was acted before by its own Blood, becauſe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in which it works are better ſuited to ſuch purpoſes, than thoſe of the Animal wherein it acted before; and it ſeems conſequent, that if the Blood and its particles be the Spirit of Life in Man, and can act all his Faculties as before hath been expreſſed, then there is no need to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the being of an immaterial intelligent Spirit in Man; <hi>quia fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pautiora, &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura nihil facit fruſtra:</hi> Wherefore I conclude, that the Blood and its Particles inflamed or glowing, are the Spirit of Life in Man as well as in Brutes, and that there neither needs, nor probably is in him ſuch an Immaterial Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Spirit, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and thoſe who maintain his Tenet, have ſuppoſed. In Confirmation of what God ſaid before to <hi>Noah,</hi> we read, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.11. <hi>The Life of the Fleſh is in the Blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an Atonement for the Souls [intending your ſelves.]</hi> Verſ. 13. <hi>He that hunts or kills a Beaſt or Fowl, he ſhall even pour out the Blood thereof, and cover it with Duſt, for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107192:84"/>it is the Life of all Fleſh; the Blood of it is for the Life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I object againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion from <hi>Job</hi> 3.11. <hi>Why died I not from the Womb? why did the Knees prevent me? or the Breaſts that I ſhould ſuck? For now ſhould I have lain, been quiet, and have ſlept, or as if a hidden untimely Birth I had not been. Verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>In Death the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and there the weary are at reſt; there the Priſoners reſt together, and hear not the Voice of the Oppreſſor, and the Servant is free from his Maſter.</hi> This Text declares to us <hi>Job</hi>'s Opinion, concerning the ſtate of dead Perſons, they all ſleep and reſt together in Death; Great and Small, Strong and Weak, Priſoners and Free-men, Servants and Maſters; Death reduces them all to a like Eſtate, of Freedom, Peace and Reſt, without any diſturbance amongſt them. He makes no mention here, or in any other place, of Rewards or Puniſhments until the Reſurrection, and then he profeſſes to expect to ſee his Redeemer with the Eyes which he had; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an Intermediate State he is utterly ſilent, which it ſeems likely he would not have been, if he had known of ſuch an Intermediate State of Souls as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his party pretend to maintain. We ſee that <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to make Death a reſt from all ſuch Sufferings as were known to him; and had he known or believed ſuch Rewards after Death as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pretends, we may reaſonably expect he ſhould have made mention of them: and from his ſilence about Rewards, and his Opinion of Reſt from Sufferings, I conclude he knew of no ſuch things to be found of Men ſoon after their Deaths. And I infer from this Argument, that the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, and the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments thereof to be expected immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after Death, was unknown to <hi>Job</hi> and the Men of his time, and is therefore a later Opinion taken up; and yet generally accepted in the times which came after him,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107192:85"/>and wants much of that Authority which its Derivation from the Primitive times of the World might have given it.</p>
                  <p>A Third Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Doctrine I take from King <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 146.2. <hi>Put not your Truſt in Princes, or in any Child of Man; for when the Breath of Man goeth forth, he ſhall turn again to his Earth, and then all his Thoughts periſh. Pſal.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Wiſe Men die and periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as well as the Ignorant and Fooliſh,</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>Man will not abide in Honour, ſeeing he may be compared to the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> Verſ. 20. He repeats again, <hi>Man being in Honour hath no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, but is compared unto the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> In the firſt proving Text <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>When the Breath of Man goeth forth, he ſhall turn again to his Earth,</hi> whence his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> may have taken his Saying, <hi>Then ſhall the Duſt return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi> Here it ſeems to me, that <hi>David</hi>'s Breath which at Death goeth forth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the ſame thing with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Spirit, <hi>returning to God who gave it:</hi> but thereunto <hi>David</hi> adds, That when this Breath is gone forth, and thereby the Man is returned to his Earth, all his Thoughts periſh; whence it ſeems there is not one Thought left in him; but we know that the Faculty of thinking can never continue without ſome Thoughts ariſing in it; and therefore, if all a Mans Thoughts periſh with his Death, I infer his Faculty of Thinking muſt do ſo too; which it cannot do, if there be ſuch a Seperately Subſiſting Intelligent Soul in Man as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſtrongly aſſerts. And if my Oppoſers ſhould contend that the Thoughts which are here ſaid to periſh, do mean the Intentions and Deſigns of the Perſon when alive. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That there is no need in this place to alter the plain Senſe of the Words; for that the plain Senſe of them may very well ſtand in this place; conceiving, that in their plain Senſe they are as true, as in that other
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107192:85"/>Senſe which my Oppoſers would put upon them, without any juſt occaſion ſo to do. And hence I am apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon this Text, that there is not ſuch a Seperable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Soul in Man as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath all along pretended. In our ſecond Text, <hi>David</hi> exhorts not to be afraid of the Riches or Glory of any Man, for when he dies he ſhall carry nothing away with him; he counted himſelf, and other Men counted him happy whilſt he liv'd, but his Happineſs ends with his Life; for Man being in Honour hath no Underſtanding, but is compared to the Beaſts that periſh. Let Men be as Rich, Wiſe and Happy, and as much in Honour as this World can afford, yet all theſe Preheminences ends with his Life, and it ſeems ſo alſo do his Miſeries; and dying or dead he may be compared to the Beaſts that periſh: his Breath goeth forth, and he turns again to the Earth from whence he was taken; and ſo alſo it is with the Beaſts that periſh. Hence it ſeems, That <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſhould have been the firſt Perſon who ſtarted the Queſtion, Whether the Spirits of Men go upward, and the Spirits of Beaſts downward or not? And after not knowing well what became of the Spirit or Breath which goes forth of a Man at Death, he ſays Tranſiently, and without any Deliberation that appears, this Spirit or Breath returns to God who gave it; but of ſuch a Spirit or the return thereof, we meet with no mention in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before his time (that I have yet found out,) and I am therefore ready to conclude with my quoted Texts out of <hi>David,</hi> that tho' Men be had in Honour during their Lives, yet at, and after Death, they may (as concerning their Natural Eſtate) be truly and reaſonably compared to the Beaſts that periſh.</p>
                  <p>My Fourth Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Tenet, I take from <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 4. That Wiſe King ſaw great and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs Oppreſſions impoſed on weak people in this World, and was thereat ſo much grieved, that he breaks forth and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107192:86"/>ſays, <hi>I praiſed the dead, which are already dead, more than the living which are yet alive; yea better is he than both they, which hath not yet been: who hath not ſeen the evil work that is done under the Sun.</hi> Chap. 9.3. <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is full of evil, and madneſs is in their heart, whilſt they live; and after that they go to the dead: for to him that is joyned to the living, there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lyon: for the living know that they ſhall die, but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for their memory is forgotten: their love, hatred, and envy, are periſhed.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor knowledge, in the grave, whither thou goeſt.</hi> Thus we find <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſeth himſelf much to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Job</hi> before hath done; declaring that Death and the Grave put an end to the doings and ſufferings of Men, without taking notice of any rewards or ſufferings, likely to befal men ſoon after their departures forth of this World; which is (in my apprehenſion) a ſort of evidence, that his words, <hi>The Spirit returns to God who gave it,</hi> did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the going of Mens Souls to Judgment before God, ſoon after their departures out of this Life. I quote like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Corroboration of <hi>Solomons</hi> fore-cited Text and Opinion, a Concurrent Evidence out of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 38.18. where <hi>Hezekiah</hi> praying to god, ſays, <hi>The Grave cannot praiſe thee, Death cannot celebrate thee; they that go down into the Pit, cannot hope for thy Truth: The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath quoted theſe Texts of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and made out of each of them an Objection againſt his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I have made one Objection out of them both, becauſe I find them tend to the ſame purpoſe; and do not ſo much labour to increaſe the number of my Objections, as to fortifie and ſtrengthen thoſe which I make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath made the Text now quoted out
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107192:88"/>of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his Tenth Objection againſt his Opinion, and thereunto anſwers, <hi>That</hi> Hezekiah<hi>'s meaning in theſe words, is that Men after Death cannot praiſe God as they do whilſt they are in this World, and in the Congregations of Men, but that ſtill they can and do praiſe God after Death in Heaven.</hi> Thereunto I reply, He ſeems to make <hi>Hezekiah</hi> mean what himſelf pleaſes; but that King's words ſeem plainly to declare, That Men after Death, neither do nor can cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate or praiſe the Name of God, without mention of ſuch a meaning as he pretends, or any need of ſuch a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I can perceive: and therefore I read and take the plain Senſe of his words to be as he hath delivered them.</p>
                  <p>In his Eleventh Objection he quotes the Text of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, The Dead know not any thing:</hi> and thereunto anſwers, That <hi>Solomon</hi>'s meaning in theſe words is, <hi>That Dead Men do not know any thing of what is done under the Sun after their Deaths.</hi> I reply, The words of the Text are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words, <hi>The Dead know not any thing</hi> [at all;] and therefore I cannot allow of his reſtraining them to Things done under the Sun; which he hath excogitated on purpoſe to ſerve his Deſign in this Point: Wherefore I leave this Expoſition as a needleſs and erroneous Invention, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed farther to conſider the whole Objection now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s. Opinion. And we find that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the Texts (of this Objection) before quoted, ſpeaks of Death as of a Reſt from Mens Labours and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and ſays, <hi>There is no device nor knowledge in the grave, whither thou goeſt; the living know that they ſhall die, but the dead know not any thing;</hi> not any the moſt common or knowable thing; not a thing ſo well known, as that Men muſt die, or that they muſt riſe again. Theſe are things the moſt commonly known to Men when they are alive, but when they are dead, they know not any thing [at all;] and to this, King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> adds, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act any thing, they cannot ſo much as Praiſe and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107192:89"/>the name of God, which Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Party will have to be the proper work of their good Souls departed. Our Text tells us in abſolute and plain Terms, the Dead cannot do ſo, comprehending under the name of Dead, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all that belong'd to the Compoſition thereof. And from theſe Premiſſes I take leave to conclude, that from theſe Texts is raiſed a ſtrong Objection againſt the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>A Fifth Objection againſt Mr, <hi>W</hi>'s Tenet, I raiſe from <hi>Eccleſs.</hi> 11.8. <hi>If a Man live many Years and rejoyce in them all, yet let him remember the days of Darkneſs, for they ſhall be many; and then he gives Liberty to the young Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the days of his Youth, and uſe his Liberty; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bids him know, that for theſe things God will bring him into Judgment:</hi> ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.14. <hi>After he had ſaid the Spirit returns to God who gave it;</hi> he adds, <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments, for God ſhall bring every work into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> Here <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorts Men to remember the day and time of their Deaths. The miſerable, as well pleaſed to reſt under that dark Shadow, and the young and joyful he exhorts to remember thoſe times as days of Darkneſs, and ſays that they ſhall be many; ſubjoyning thereunto, that [after thoſe days] God will call Men to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all that they have done in this World, tho' it be never ſo ſecretly acted; and even for every idle word, at the Day of Judgment an Account muſt be made; and much more of Mens ſmalleſt Actions, whether the ſame be good or whether they be evil: by the days of Darkneſs which <hi>Solomon</hi> here mentions, ſeem ſomewhat clearly to be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the days which immediately ſucceed the death of the Perſon; they are days of Darkneſs, as Darkneſs it ſelf, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and made dark with the ſhadow of Death; and our Text ſays thoſe Days ſhall be many: and therefore he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts Men in their greateſt Jollity to remember them;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107192:89"/>but our Oppoſers (contrary to the Tenor of this Text,) endeavour to perſwade us that there are no days of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all in Death, for that when the Breath of Man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, or ceaſeth in him, his Subſtantial Intelligent, and then Seperated Soul or Spirit, either returns to God, or goes before him, to Judgment, or is carried by Angels, or is hurried by Devils, into very different places; concerning which I do not find they are well agreed among themſelves: but howſoever that may fall out, they are all very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that their Seperate Intelligent Spirit is at greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and is more active and knowing than it was during its confinement to the Body; ſo as inſtead of thoſe days of Darkneſs which <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions, the Spirit or Principle of Life in Man enjoys a greater light, activity, and freedom, than it had before the Death of that Party whom it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inliven'd and acted. And this (if it be true) ſeems directly contrary to that which <hi>Solomon</hi> in this Text hath affirmed: <hi>There are days of darkneſs, and many of them,</hi> ſays the Text of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>That at the death of the party, or ſoon after, good mens ſouls enjoy much more light, liberty, and glory, than every they had before:</hi> ſo as they ſeem to ſay, the ſouls of good men have no dark days at all; and therefore men that are jovial and merry, need have no regard to ſuch days of Darkneſs as <hi>Solomon</hi> in this Text gives them warning of. And yet ſuch men do not uſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that a Solemn and General Judgment ſhall appear after thoſe many days of Darkneſs ſhall be conſummate and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: and therein they agree with <hi>Solomons</hi> Opinion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho concerning his days of Darkneſs they ſeem very much to differ from him: but if his Opinion may prevail in this Caſe, it offers a ſtrong Objection againſt the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Thus far Objections have been drawn out of the Old Teſtament, and we now proceed to draw like Objections from the New.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:107192:90"/>
                  <p>A Sixth Objection thence to be raiſed, I take from John 14. 2 <hi>In my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions, I go to prepare a place for you; and if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you again to my ſelf; that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> Luke 21.26. <hi>The powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken, and then ſhall they ſee the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory; and when theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh;</hi> viz. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for the Saints.</hi> Col. 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life, ſhall appear, then ſhall ye appear with him alſo in glory.</hi> 1 John. 3 2. <hi>Beloved, now are we the ſons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> The Apoſtle knew (whilſt in this life) that we are the Sons of God, but he did not know what we ſhall be [after death] nor was that likely to be known, till Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at his Second Coming; and then he knew that the Saints ſhould be made like Chriſt, and appear with him in glory; as <hi>Paul</hi> hath above aſſerted. 2 Tim. 4.7. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, ſhall give me at that day; and not to me only, but to them alſo that love his appearing.</hi> The Crown it ſeems was laid up for him, even whil'ſt he was alive; but was not expected to be given him till the time of Chriſts ſecond appearing, and then it would alſo be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all thoſe who love and deſire that appearing. 1 Tim. 1.10. <hi>The Lord give mercy to the houſe of</hi> Oneſiphorus, <hi>the Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi> He doth not pray that his Friend may find mercy at the time of his Death, or at an Intermediate Judgment, but at that [great and laſt] Day. All theſe Texts have been quoted to give Evidence of the Time
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107192:86"/>when Rewards and Puniſhments after Death, are warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to be expected. They all expreſs the time thereof to be at our Lords Second Coming, and the laſt Great Day of Judgment thereupon enſuing; but make no mention of Recompences warrantably to be expected, ſoon after the times of mens Death, or in any Intermediate State between Death and the Reſurrection: Nor hath the Scripture (that I find) any mention in other places, of Recompences to be diſtribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed in ſuch an In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ermediate State, except in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables and Trances only. I have in this Objection repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Texts out of which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> made Objections ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt his own Opinion; but I have linked them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſtrengthened them with other Texts of Scripture of the like import, <hi>quia vis unita fortior.</hi> Concerning Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Texts I pretend here to examine the Anſwers which he hath ſingly given to each of them. To the Text of our appearing with Chriſt in Glory, he anſwers and grants, That the appearance here ſpoken of, intends that of the Laſt Judgment; for till then the Saints cannot be ſaid to appear in Glory with Chriſt; and yet, ſays he, they may be in Glory with Chriſt, tho' they do not appear in ſuch Glory to Men. I reply, That tho they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſuch Glory to Men, yet if there be truly ſuch a thing as he maintains, they do appear in Glory before God and the Angels and Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect; and therefore may truly be ſaid to appear in Glory; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, they do not, till Chriſts ſecond Coming and appearing in Glory. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, His ſort of Souls may appear in Heaven in Glory before that time; but it lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to make ſome proof that they do ſo: which he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offers, nor I think is able to perform: and therefore I think his Anſwer to this Text is of ſmall weight. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Text to which he makes an Anſwer, is that of <hi>Paul</hi>'s expecting a Crown to be given him at that day, or the time of the Laſt Judgment; and he grants, that the time
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107192:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>intended by the word, <hi>That Day,</hi> is that of the Laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſays thereupon, <hi>What then? It follows not thence that therefore there are not Souls in glory before that time: for Kings may reign before they receive their Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſo ſhall we be Kings and Prieſts in our Souls unto God in the Heavens.</hi> This Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pretends to ſay out of his own fruitful Invention, without offering any Proof of our being Kings and Prieſts in Heaven to God in our bare and naked Souls only: for neither any of our before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Texts do mention ſuch things, nor are they to be found in any other Text of Scripture whatſoever, except the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion appearing to St. <hi>John</hi> when he was intranced: for the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> makes no mention of being in Heaven, or the Preferment of being Kings and Prieſts to God, or in his preſence; and therefore I am ready to reject this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or fancy of Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s brain, and to conceive that all our quoted Texts are true, according to the common ſenſe of their words. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> father ſays, <hi>There are no words or ſyllables in this Text that deny intervening Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Saints before that day; which it muſt have done before it could ſerve his Oppoſers purpoſe.</hi> Thereunto replying, I ſay, there ſeems to be no need of ſuch a Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: for that if God or Man, promiſe to give Rewards or Puniſhments at an appointed time, there is no need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, they will not give ſuch things at other times; nor can there be a warrantable expectation of them at other times, except ſuch a thing be alſo expreſly declared: which is not done in this or theſe Texts, or any other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Texts of Scripture, which I can find; and therefore I think Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Anſwer to this Objection is clearly inſufficient: and as ſuch I leave it, and proceed further to object againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion from all the Texts laſt before quoted. I ſay then that all theſe Texts concur ſtrongly in their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That the Reſurrection and Laſt Judgment are the time when all men may warrantably and certainly expect
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107192:87"/>to be rewarded or puniſhed according to their Works and Actions in this World: becauſe that is evidently declared by a ſtrong concurrence of Scripture Teſtimonies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other time plainly declared in any other Text of Scripture, when men may warrantably expect ſuch recompences after their Departures out of this World: and thence I conceive the Texts before quoted are a ſtrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Expectation of Rewards, or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being given to the Souls of Dead Perſons immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after their Departures out of this World.</p>
                  <p>A Seventh Objection I make in the ſame manner that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath put his Seventh Objection againſt his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; Where he ſays, <hi>If the Souls of Men paſt their Tryal as ſoon as they are dead, what needs any other day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Will Chriſt try Men after Sentence?</hi> To this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>I have proved already, The Souls of Men cannot be kill'd, and ſo cannot die; and that the Souls of Men at death do return to the Lord; and other things relating to its partial Judgment which it ſhall receive.</hi> To this I reply, His proof of the Souls not dying, remains <hi>sub judice;</hi> his Text, that the Soul returns to God, proves not its going before him for Judgment: and for proof of his partial Judgment he hath produc'd no Text of Scripture at all, nor do I think a Text that ſo proves, can be quoted out of the Bible.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> proceeding, asks, <hi>Who art thou that reaſoneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? wilt thou teach God how he ſhall govern the World, or what Judgments he ſhall uſe upon Men? It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that God hath intimated his Will, there ſhall be ſuch Judgments, and we are humbly to believe he hath reaſon for his ſo doing, although our ſhallow brains cannot comprehend it.</hi> To this I reply, That I am ready to do as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, <hi>viz.</hi> That if God do declare to us his mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnet to have divers and different Trials and Judgments of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107192:88"/>Men, I am ready to ſubmit to the belief thereof, altho I am not able to apprehend the congruity or reaſon thereof. But Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Anſwer ſets out no proof at all of Gods deſign or meaning to paſs ſuch ſeveral Trials and Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men, as he ſuppoſes; nor doth his whole Book give us good proof thereof: and himſelf doth not require men to believe that God proceeds in ways not congruous to the Reaſons of Men, except God doth ſomewhere declare that he doth or will do ſo. Whereas Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways proved Gods Will ſo to do, then from his own Expoſitions, Collections, Inferences, and Concluſions, which all ſeem to be the proper fruits of his own Invention: Upon which the Old Rule muſt take hold, <hi>Poſito quolibet ſequitur quidlibet;</hi> and ſo if we ſuffer him to lay the Cards, he will always deal them to his own advantage: but I have no inclination to bear with ſuch dealing, and therefore do reject his Anſwer to this Objection, as infirm and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Well, but then ſays Mr. <hi>W. If this Anſwer will not ſatisfie you, I doubt not but the righteous Judge will ſatisfie you of the reaſon of that Great Day, notwithſtanding parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular judgments upon Men, and the ſpirits of Men before that Day.</hi> I find no manner of proving force in theſe words of Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s, they ſeem rather a Threat than a Proof, and a product rather of his own Will than of his Knowledge, or a reaſonable Inference from any Text of Scripture. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he bids his Oppoſers be ſilent, leaſt God reprove them. And having made this Reply to his Anſwer, I am content to be ſilent, and proceed no father thereupon: but as to the Incongruity charg'd by the Objection upon Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I ſay, that it ſeems very incongruous to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that God ſhould call Men to a Solemn Tryal at their Deaths, and there paſs Judgment, and award Execution thereupon; and after they have long continu'd in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then to call them to a new Tryal, and give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgment upon them, with a like award of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107192:90"/>on as before; this ſeems a very unlikely Proceeding of God towards Men: and yet if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> or any of his Partakers, have proved, or can prove, from any plain or clear Text or Texts of Scripture, that God will uſe this Courſe of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt Men, I am ready to ſubmit my own reaſon and opinion thereunto; but not to the many words or conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> farther offers in his Anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. We read <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Our Lords Sentence at the Laſt Judgment, runs thus, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world; depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> not ſaying, Return ye bleſſed unto the happy Manſions of Heaven, from whence ye came; or, Return ye curſed into thoſe dark and dreadful Regions, where ye were before; but come ye and go ye to ſuch Places and Regions as it ſeems proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they were not acquainted with before; whence it ſeems inferrable, that thoſe Intermediate Tryals, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Executions which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> maintains, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Chimerical and Imaginary, without having that real truth in them, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Party en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to maintain; and the Objection before made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them ſeems ſtrong enough to ſhake and oppoſe their Pretenſions.</p>
                  <p>An Eighth Objection I raiſe from 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. <hi>If Chriſt be Preached, that he roſe from the Dead; how ſay ſome among you, that there is no Reſurrection of the Dead, but if there be no Reſurrection of the Dead, then is Chriſt not riſen, and if Chriſt be not riſen, then is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion both vain and falſe.</hi> verſ. 18. <hi>and then they alſo which are faln aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> verſ. 32. <hi>If after the manner of Men I have fought with Beaſts at</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>what advantageth it me if the Dead riſe not? Let us eat and drink for too morrow we die. Then the Apoſtle finds fault with Communications which call in Queſtion the Belief
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107192:91"/>of the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> verſ. 52. <hi>At the last Trump the Dead ſhall be raiſed Incorruptible, and we [who are then alive] ſhall be changed, and then ſhall Death be ſwallowed up in Victory.</hi> verſ. 58. <hi>And therefore my beloved Brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, always abounding in the work of the Lord; foraſmuch as ye know, that your Labour is not in Vain in the Lord;</hi> [the Reſurrection of the Dead being thus certainly and undoubtedly proved to you] you muſt be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable in your Religion, <hi>knowing that your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in Vain in the Lord.</hi> In Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Thirteenth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt his own Opinion, he propounds it thus, our Opponents alledge, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. of this Chapter, infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that if there be no Reſurrection, <hi>Then thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed;</hi> which they ſay could not follow, if there were any ſtate of a Bleſſed Life for a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Soul; for that tho' there were no Reſurrection of the Dead, yet Souls already in Heaven ſhould ſtill be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py there, and not be periſhed for want of a Reſurrection of the Perſon. To this Mr. <hi>W.</hi> anſwers, <hi>That in the courſe of this Text, St</hi> Paul <hi>intends to prove the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and to teach, that if his Reſurrection was not true, then all thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt ſhould be periſhed.</hi> There Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays thus, now to prove that Chriſt was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, which was the Antecedent of the Apoſtles Argument; he argues, either Chriſt is riſen, or we have been preachers of what is Vain and falſe, <hi>and then thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> Hereunto I reply, That we do not read in this or any other Text, that there was a Diſpute among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about the Reſurrection of Chriſt, but that it was both preached and believed amongſt them that he was riſen from the Dead: and from that Eſtabliſhed and Undoubted Truth, the Apoſtle inferrs the Reſurrection of the Dead, and ſays, the one of them is as true as the other; but if there be no Reſurrection of the Dead, then is Chriſt not riſen, and if theſe be not both true, then all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107192:91"/>Chriſtian Religion is vain and falſe, <hi>and thoſe who are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſort of arguing ſeems to ſuppoſe a poſſibility, <hi>that thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt may be periſhed,</hi> which were a vain ſuppoſal, if their Separated Souls did ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and were Immortal; becauſe that whether there be a Reſurrection or not a Reſurrection, and whether Chriſt were riſen or not riſen, yet Seperate Souls would ſtill have a Subſiſtence, and not be periſhed, as here our Apoſtle ſuppoſes they would be, if the Reſurrections ſo preached to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not true. So as our Apoſtles Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſeems not well to agree with Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence; but it is at full agreement with the material Opinion, who maintain as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, that if there be no Reſurrection, then all hope of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences future to this Life are Vain, <hi>and thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays farther, <hi>There is no Way or Means for expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Sins, and removal of the Curſe, beſides the Death of Chriſt.</hi> I ſay, we are taught by this Text, that his Death would avail us nothing without his Reſurrection, [and our Reſurrection alſo.] Then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes, if Chriſt be not riſen, the Wrath of God ſtill abides on you; and ſays, this is ſpoken becauſe his Reſurrection was to be the Evidencing Sign among the reſt, that his Death was accepted of the Father, for that end he profeſſes to lay it down which was to expiate our Sins. I ſay, he profeſſeth to lay it down, that he may take it up again, and he was convinced that it would be accepted of his Father before he laid it down, and then he roſe again for our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather than as a Teſtimony, that his Death was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Father, of which there was before no doubt at all. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> goes on and ſays, <hi>He denies that the Apoſtle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ntends by theſe Reaſonings to prove immediately the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of all Men, but only as their Reſurrection comes in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107192:92"/>upon the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the only thing in theſe Verſes now named, that the Apoſtle was proving.</hi> To this I reply, That the Reſurrection of the Dead, and the Doubt which ſome Men had thereof, is the principal and only Queſtion which I conceive to be diſputed of in this Text; for we do not read of doubt made by any Man concerning the Reſurrection of Chriſt; for Chriſt was preached to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that he roſe from the Dead, and this Doctrine was receiv'd and believ'd by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and yet ſome of them denyed the general Reſurrection of the Dead: and to convince thoſe Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Error; the Apoſtle tells them, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſurrection of the Dead, is as true and certain as the Reſurrection of Chriſt was, and therefore I think the main ſcope of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was to convince the doubting <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and to prove the general Reſurrection of the Dead: and which of us two have the Right in this Point, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Judgment of ſuch Readers as will conſult St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Text thereupon. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays further to his Oppoſers, the manner of the Apoſtles Argument is not as ye conceive, <hi>That if the Bodies of the Saints do never riſe, then ye are in your Sins, and thoſe that are dead in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> Replying thereunto, I ſay, that I know none of his Oppoſers who argue in ſuch a manner as he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them, nor that examine or conſider the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body; becauſe we do not find in the whole Tenor of the Bible that expreſſion of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body. It is true, that as we now uſe the Apoſtles Creed in Engliſh, we find there mention'd the Reſurrection of the Body; but clearly, we therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from our Originals of that Creed, both in the Greek and Latin Languages, the Greek calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the Latin calls it <hi>Reſurrectionem Carnis,</hi> the true Engliſh of both which Expreſſions, is the Reſurrection of the Fleſh; and after that manner I think it ought to be mended in our
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107192:92"/>Engliſh Tranſlations or Creed. Whence it ſeemeth not to follow that the Body ſhould be firſt raiſed, and then a Subſtantial Intelligent Spirit <hi>ab extra</hi> ſhould be put into it; but that ſuch raiſing ſhall be like the firſt formation of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the covering of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> dry Bones with Fleſh and Skin, and the filling them with Blood and Humors, apt to be kindled and inflamed by ſuch a moderate Wind or Breath as may be breathed upon them or into them, for kindling the flame of Life in their vital Parts, thence to be communicated to all the reſt of their Bodies. <hi>John</hi> 5.28. <hi>The Hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his Voice and ſhall come forth; they that have done Good to the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done Evil to the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> The manner after which Perſons ſo raiſed ſhall come forth, ſeems to be by forming the Fleſh, Bones, Arteries, Veins, Nerves and Sinews, into the ſhape of a humane Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining therein ſuch Blood, Humors and Organs as are needful for the production and perfection of Life, and all the Faculties and Powers of a humane Perſon, whoſe Blood and Humors will then be apt for kindling into a Flame, or glowing of the Blood by ſuch a moderate Breath as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> was directed to call for, to come from the four Winds, and breath upon theſe newly formed Perſons that they may live, which done, the newly formed Perſons are thereby made living, able to hear the Voice of the Son of God, and at his Call to come out of their Graves, and deliver themſelves from the ſtrong Bands of Death; and ſuch I conceive, the riſing of the Dead will be, not a partial, but a total Reſurrection of the Perſon, not firſt the Body rais'd, and then an Intelligent Soul be injected thereinto, for the Body cannot riſe or come out of its Grave without a Spirit of Life, or ſuch a ſort of Soul as is natural, ſuitable, and fitted for that Performance. I do therefore reject the expreſſion by him uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107192:93"/>Reſurrection of the Body; becauſe it is no where uſed in the Scripture: and becauſe there is no ſuch thing in Nature, as that a Body ſhould riſe and live without a Soul: what riſes therefore is not only the Body, but the Perſon which was dead, a very like, or his very ſame Perſon which before had died. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in the Concluſion of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſays to his Oppoſers, that it is a ſtrange Inference ye draw from this Text, <hi>That becauſe it is certain that Chriſt is riſen, that therefore the Souls of Men are mortal.</hi> I reply, This would be a very ſtrange Inference indeed, if his Oppoſers either ſaid ſo or thought ſo, but they profeſs to do neither the one nor the other; but this they do ſay and believe, that if the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and the General Reſurrection of the Dead, be not both true, <hi>then all thoſe who are fallen aſleep</hi> (tho' never ſo good) <hi>are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed;</hi> and conſequently, that the Souls of Men have not a Seperate Subſiſtence after the death of the Perſon: and thus I finiſh my Reply to Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Anſwer given to this Objection, and proceed to the giving concurrent Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Texts before quoted, for ſtrengthning the force of this my Eighth Objection.</p>
                  <p>Our Apoſtle having finiſh'd this Text, goes on in the ſame Chapter to <hi>Verſ.</hi> 32. And there ſays, <hi>If after the manner of Men I have fought with Beaſts at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>what advantageth it me if the Dead riſe not? Let us eat and drink for too Morrow we die.</hi> Which sayings I think may be thus rightly Paraphraſed, <hi>Whatſoever Sufferings I undergo for Chriſt's ſake in this World, they will advantage me nothing, if the Dead riſe not, and then we need no more in this World, but to eat and drink and die, and there's an and of us.</hi> And if this Saying be true, and the very meaning of our Apoſtle in this Text, I think it gives a fatal blow to the Seperate Subſiſtence of Souls; and yet our Apoſtle proceeds further in this Chapter, to <hi>Verſe</hi> 52. Where he ſays, <hi>The Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the Dead ſhall be rais'd uncorruptible, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107192:93"/>we [who are then alive] ſhall be changed;</hi> and the laſt Verſe of this Chapter he adds, <hi>Therefore my beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know your Labour is not in Vain in the Lord;</hi> for I have given you as certain Proofs as Faith can deſire, that there ſhall be a General Reſurrection of the Dead, at which time all People ſhall be rewarded or puniſhed according to their Works. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. The Saints indured great Perſecutions and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not accepting Deliverance from them, becauſe they expected a better Reſurrection. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14. <hi>When thou makeſt a Feaſt, do not only bid thy Friends and rich Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who are likely to make thee a Recompence; but bid alſo the Poor, the Maimed, the Lame and the Blind, who cannot Recompenſe thee, and therefore for thy ſo doing, thou ſhalt be Recompenſed at the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</hi> And now I demand one Text of Scripture to be produced, where it is ſaid, <hi>That Men for their good Works done in this World, ſhall be Recompenſed at or ſoon after their Deaths.</hi> I know of no Text that declares this to us, or from which it can with clear Reaſon be collected; and therefore I ſay, that the Reaſon given us why our Labour ſhall not be in Vain in the Lord, is becauſe there ſhall certainly be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Dead, and after that a Judgment, wherein every Perſon ſhall be rewarded according to his Works; and upon theſe Grounds I am ready to conclude, that this my Eighth Objection ſtrongly batters and aſſaults, and even overthrows the Opinion of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>A Ninth Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, I raiſe from 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.13. Where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>I would not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them that are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not, even as others which have no hope: For if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again; even ſo
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107192:94"/>them alſo that ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him;</hi> and ſo goes on deſcribing the manner and effects of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead; adding, Comfort one another with theſe Words: I offer this for you Comfort, that there ſhall certainly be a Reſurrection of the Dead, wherein your dead Friends alſo ſhall riſe again; and I would have you make this a Comfort to you, concerning both your dead Friends and your dying Selves, adviſing you to repoſe your hopes thereupon, and to comfort your ſelves and one another, with your Diſcourſes and Communications con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Our Apoſtle appears here, comforting the Hearts of his Correſpondents againſt the ſufferings of Death, either by their Friends, or by themſelves, and takes his ground of Comfort in ſuch Caſes, from our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Dead; and thereupon I obſerve that he doth not ground and Hope or Comfort upon the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, or its going to Heaven immediately after Death: which gives me a firm ground of perſwaſion, that he either did not know of this Opinion, or he did not believe it; for if he had believed this Doctrine to be true, I think he could not have forgotten, or forborn to give his Diſciples Comfort from that Topick: becauſe ſuch Comforts would have been much nearer, than thoſe which he derived from the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, and would have been both a more ſhort and ſure way, to that Salvation and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs which Men deſire; and therefore if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had believed this Doctrine to be true, I think he could have no reaſon for his balking it in this place; but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of Reaſon muſt have ſaid, Brethren, comfort your ſelves againſt Sorrows, for your Friends Deaths and the fear of your own, by conſidering the happy State of thoſe which die in the Lord, for that their Spirits or Souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon parting from their Bodies, either return to God who gave them, and are received into Heaven and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107192:96"/>Happineſs, or they ſhall be carried by Angels into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſom, and there enjoy at leaſt, a bleſſed Reſt from their Labours, and all future Sufferings. I doubt not, but that the Divines of our time would readily have adminiſtred ſuch Comforts as theſe to the Friends of dead People, or even to the dying Perſons themſelves; but in our quoted Text, we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with his Correſpondents upon this like Occaſion: for the only Comfort which thereupon he propounds to them, is drawn from the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, which in this Place he ſomewhat at large delivers, as knowing that to be ſufficient for Mens Comfort in ſuch Caſes, without remembring or believing our late comfortable Doctrine or Opinion, of the Souls going to Heaven immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death; and hereupon I conclude, that this Doctrine was either not known to him, or not believed by him, and that therefore it is an Error, and no certain Truth, or the very Truth of God.</p>
                  <p>A Tenth Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, I raiſe from the concurrent Teſtimonies of many Scripture Texts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the expectation of future Rewards or Puniſhments looked for after this Life, unto the time of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead, and the Laſt Judgment, without finding and ſuch Expectation at the time of Men's Deaths referred to, or mention'd in any Text of Scripture. In the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s own Objections, he hath made this the Sixth, and propounds it thus, The Scriptures (ſay my Oppoſers) do frequently make mention of the Great and General Day of Judgment, and refer all the Rewards of the Saints to that Day, and ſo all the Puniſhments of the Wicked, therefore the Souls of Men die with their Bodies, as being uncapable of Rewards or Puniſhments till then. To this Objection he anſwers conceſſively, and ſays, I do partly acknowledge the firſt part of what ye ſay, that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107192:97"/>Scriptures do frequently make mention of that great Day; and again, that the greateſt Rewards and Puniſhments are reſerved to that Day: but I deny the later part of what ye ſay, becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks of the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and of the Soul of the Thief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Paradiſe that day he died, and of the Spirit of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man returning to God at Death, to be dealt with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they did in the Body; and this he ſays is enough to blunt the edge of his preſent Objection. And hereunto I reply, That what he hath ſaid concerning the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, hath before been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and ſo hath that of the Thief's Soul being in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe that day, and proved to be invalid Teſtimonies of the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence. His Third Teſtimony of the Spirits returning to God, ſeems to be miſ-recited; for the Text doth not ſay it returns to God to be dealt with according to what they did in the Body; which Words he adjoins with as much Confidence to the Text, as if they might be there found written, and were part of the Text it ſelf; ſo as unwary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examining Readers might ſoon be miſtaken thereupon. In what manner, and to what purpoſe <hi>Solomon</hi> might intend this return of Souls to God hath been before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed; and I ſtill confide, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Party will not be able to prove, that theſe words of <hi>Solomon</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Souls of dead Perſons going before God to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as here he hath without any heſitation deliver'd it. And therefore I conclude that his Anſwer hath very little blunted the edge of our preſent Objection: I obſerve it as an Art in Diſputing, that it may be advantageous to grant in an eaſie and tranſient faſhion, ſuch Objections as Men find themſelves utterly unable to anſwer; and I think Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath uſed this Art in tranſiently granting the firſt part of this Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scriptures do frequently refer the expectation of Rewards or Puniſhments after this
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107192:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>Life, and unto the Reſurrection and the Day of Judgment; and whereas I have ſaid before, that there is no mention in Scripture of ſuch Expectations, at or ſoon after the time of Mens Deaths; he gives us here three of the moſt pregnant Inſtances which he could find in Scripture, for proving that Rewards and Puniſhments are beſtowed by God at the time of Mens Deaths; but the force of theſe Inſtances hath before been obſtructed by thoſe Anſwers which have been ſeverally given them in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I am not without ſome Temptation of drawing out of the Scripture a Catalogue of ſuch Texts as do with great Evidence and Strength, ſet forth and prove, that the time of the Reſurrection and the Day of Judgment, are not alone the principal, but the only times whereat or wherein Recompences future to this Life, are warrantably and certainly to be expected by Mankind; but becauſe I have ſaid much, and quoted divers Texts of Scripture upon that Subject before, and am now willing to ſave my ſelf and my Reader the <hi>tedium</hi> of ſuch a long Repetition. I will refer the Examiners of this Objection unto thoſe Texts which have before been quoted to that purpoſe, and to ſuch others as themſelves may meet with upon the peruſal of the Scripture. And with this round number of Ten, the Objections which I make againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion out of Scripture, ſhall be finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Yet I farther intend to add thereunto, two or three Objections againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, derived from Natural Reaſon and the Experiences of Men. And firſt, I begin from the Nature and Compoſition of the Humane Perſon, and thereupon I obſerve, that there are three things prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally and abſolutely neceſſary for the Subſiſtence and Life of the Humane Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Blood, Breath and Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thereupon do agree with <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Life, the Animals is in the Blood, or that the Blood is the Life thereof, whoſe inflamed Particles are the Spirits which act
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107192:98"/>the Perſon, and as well the Head as the Members, ſo long as Life continues in the Body. Next to which, the Breath hath a Principal and abſolutely neceſſary Faculty and Power of fanning and inflaming ſuch Particles of the Blood, as are imployed in every part of the Body, and for refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the internal parts of the Body with a perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, which keeps the Pariſtaltick Motion always in action amongſt the inward and moſt vital parts of the Body; whence daily Experience aſſures us, that by ſtopping of the Breath but for ſome few Moments, the Spirit of Life in Man, becomes abſolutely ſuffocated and extinguiſhed, and without Breath no Humane Art or Power can prolong the Life of the Perſon, or other Animal whatſoever. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Nutriment, it is only ſo far neceſſary to the Life of the Creature, as the Blood thereof waſtes and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, by the Circular Continual Motion, and the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof.</p>
                  <p>In ſome long continuing and weakening Diſeaſes, the Motion of the Blood hath been ſo weak, and the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof ſo faint, as that in ſuch Perſons, there need no Nutriment in a long time, for reſtoring the waſte of Blood in ſuch Perſons: but in ordinary ways of living, our Experience aſſures us, that if the daily waſte of Blood be not ſupplied by Nouriſhment ſutable to the Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, the Perſon muſt diminiſh in his Strength and Vigor, and finally periſh and die for want of ſuch ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as ſhould reſtore the ſtock of the waſted Blood, and furniſh the ſeveral parts with ſuch moiſture and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as thereunto ſhall be abſolutely needful and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. We find an Inſtance of this Condition in <hi>David</hi>'s Acts, when he came to <hi>Ziklag,</hi> his Servants found an <hi>Egyptian</hi> in the Field ſtarved, and at the next Door to Death; for he had neither eaten nor drink in three Days and Nights before, but upon adminiſtring freſh Suſtenance to his waſted Spirits, they became reſtored in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107192:94"/>great meaſure to their former Activity; which I conceive happen'd to him as it may do in the caſe of a Lamp, whoſe Oyl is ſpent and exhauſted: the Light will firſt grow dim, and be ready to fail and be extinguiſhed, but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by more Oyl adminiſtred to it, it will ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Flame and Light which it had before. The Text ſays, <hi>When this Man had eaten, the Spirit came again to him.</hi> In like manner it is related of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> his being ready to die for thirſt, but as ſoon as he had drank of the Water which iſſued from his Jaw-bone, that Text ſays, <hi>his Spirit came again, and he revived.</hi> I conceive thoſe Places to be parallelled with that Text of 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.22. <hi>Where in raiſing the Widows Son,</hi> Elijah <hi>prayed, Lord let this Childs Soul come into him again;</hi> and the Spirit of the Child came into him again, and he revived. I conceive that the coming again of theſe three Spirits, as they are expreſs'd in very like words, ſo they were all of a like nature; the Spirits of the two former were not quite extinguiſhed, as that of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Child was, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the revival of them all, it is ſaid their Spirits came to them again, which I think may ſignifie the rekindling or recontinuing of that Flame of Life in their Blood, which we call the Vital Flame, and whereby the Humane Machine or Microcoſme is put in motion, and acted ſo long as it pleaſes God to continue Life unto it; in the Caſe of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> at <hi>Ziklag,</hi> we may perceive that preſently upon the coming of his Spirit to him again, the Activity and Uſe of all his Senſations returned inſtantly to him, ſo as he could not only move, hear, ſee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Memory became apt and ready for Service as before; whence I think we may reaſonably collect, that the Original of Acting and Underſtanding may proceed from the Activity and Motion of the Blood, and the infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med particles thereof, which together with Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, produce the Senſations, Affections, Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107192:95"/>and Memories of Men. And having thus propounded, and in ſome meaſure proved, that Blood, Breath and Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, are all abſolutely neceſſary for continuance of the Life of Man, ſo as he cannot long abide in Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the continual aſſiſtance of every one of them; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to apply them to thoſe different ſorts of Spirits about which we are now diſputing; and therein, if we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and make application of them to the Extraneous, telligent and Seperate Spirit, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> maintains to be the Spirit of Life in Man; I think we muſt find, that all theſe three Natural Incidents to the life of Man, have no coherence at all with ſuch a Spirit, but are very incongruous with the Being and Nature of it; becauſe that foraſmuch as we know concerning the nature of ſuch a Spirit, Nutriment ſeems not to be neceſſary for the Subſiſtence thereof, and much leſs do Breath and Blood, or the Spirits of it ſeem pertinent, or appliable to the nature of ſuch an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Spirit; and therefore if ſuch a Spirit were truly the Spirit of Life in Man, the three materials before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as natural and inſeperable Incidents to the continuance of Man's Life, ſhould not be ſo abſolutely neceſſary for that deſign, as by daily Experience they are found to be: but if we ſhall now turn to the other ſide, and make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to that Superfine, yet Material and Unintelligent Spirit, which before hath been deſcribed, we muſt find that there will be a true and real neceſſity of the three before-named Natural Incidents, for the Support, Supply, and Continuance of its Activity, and of Life its ſelf; ſo as by this Hypotheſis the Phaenomena of nature in Man are more clearly anſwered, and may be better ſolved, than can be done by applying theſe Natural Incidents, to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable, Intelligent, and Extraneous Spirit in Man; and I therefore conclude it more probable, that the Spirit of Life in Man is rather Material and Unintelligent, than that it is an Intelligent and Seperable Spirit, ſuch as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Partakers maintain the ſame to be.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:107192:95"/>
                  <p>A Second Objection from Nature againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I raiſe from the further Conſideration of the Humane Perſon, and more particularly from the Bodily Organs thereof; and ſay thereupon, that God or Nature hath ſo framed and fitted every one of them, as they are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apt for thoſe Offices, which they were intended to perform; of which for Example we may name the Eyes and Tongue, which are admirably framed and fitted for their ſeveral Offices, ſo as the Spirit of Life is by means of theſe Inſtruments able to perform ſuch Actions as Nature intended them for; and yet the Perfection or Defects in thoſe performances, ſeem not ſo much to depend upon that Spirit which informs and acts them, as upon the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, ſoundneſs and perfection of the Organs themſelves. Without ſuch Organs, the Man can neither ſee nor ſpeak, but when the Organs are ſound and perfect, the owner can uſe them as perfectly as any other can ordinarily do; but if there be any Obſtruction in the Optick Nerves, or in thoſe which act the Tongue, the Spirit of Life in the Owner can act them no otherways than they are ſtill capable of, for the Tongue will liſp, ſtammer, ſtop, ſtruggle and blutter, do the Man, and his Spirit of Life, what they can, for the rectification of ſuch Infirmities; and ſo will the Eyes be purr-blind, double or treble ſighted, weak, dim and blindiſh, do the Owner and his Spirit of Life what they can for the Recovery and rectifying of them; ſo as the Spirit of Life can act the Organ to no higher a Degree of perfection, than the ſoundneſs and rectitude of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it ſelf will bear; nor act it in other manner than it is fit and capable at that time to be acted: and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the principal perfection of the faculties of Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Speaking, lies more in the ſound State and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Organ, than in the power and energy of that Spirit which acts them; and yet I think that the purity and force of ſuch Spirits, may be very conducing to the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107192:96"/>perfect performance of the Faculty; and yet can act no farther than the Bodily Organ is in its own State and Nature capable of: whence there is a dependance of the Faculty, both upon the Spirit and upon the Organ. But I think that the Differences which we find amongſt Mens Faculties of this Nature (wherein there are great Degrees of Perfection and Imperfection) do more depend upon the ſoundneſs and fitneſs of the Organ, than upon the different Degrees of Activity amongſt the Spirits of them. And if we ſhall aſcend to the conſideration of the Humane Intellect, we may find that the acting and perfection thereof, lies in, and by the Brain, and that the Phantaſie lies prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally or only in the fore-part of the Head, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Eſteemative Faculty in the middle of it, and the Memory in the back part thereof; whence if there happen any defect or craſineſs in any of theſe Faculties or Powers of Intellect, Phyſicians both do, and ought to apply their Medicines for the recovery of them, to the Organs or parts of the Head, which are the proper Inſtruments of ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. If the Phantaſie be diſordered, the Remedies thereof muſt be apply'd to the fore-part of the Head, or the Fore-head: if the Judgment be craz'd, ſuch Remedies muſt be apply'd to the middle part of the Head, and if the Memory fail, application for the Recovery thereof muſt be made to the back part of the Head; and if Medicines for the Recovery of the Phantaſie be apply'd to the back part of the Head, they will be ineffectual to that purpoſe, and ſo <hi>e contra,</hi> if Men will apply Remedies to the back part of the Head, for recovering the diſorders of the Phantaſie. Men of indifferent Skill can make ſhrewd gueſſes concerning the largeneſs and perfection of thoſe Faculties, by Seeing, Feeling, and peruſing the Dimenſions and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonings of Mens Heads. If Mens Fore-heads be large and high, they may reaſonably be thought to be of large Phantaſies and Inventions; and if the back part of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107192:98"/>Head be likewiſe large, and ſomething protuberant in the lower parts of it, tending towards the Neck, we may gueſs the Owner of that Organ to have a capacious and ſtrong Memory; and concerning the Judgment, we may think that the largeneſs of the whole Head (if it be well fill'd, and without any empty Spaces in it) is a great ſign of a good and ſound Judgment, in thoſe Perſons to whom God hath given ſuch an Organ; and from theſe Topicks I am ready to inferr, that the perfections of the Intellect, depend more upon the Soundneſs and Gapacities of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, than upon the Excellencies and Perfection of the Spirit which acts them, and yet the Power and Purity of ſuch Spirits muſt be ſtill admitted to have a great effect in the Production, and in the Degrees of Perfection in this Operation. If we ſhall particularly conſider the Nature of that we call the Spirit of Life in Man, we may perhaps find it ſubject to divers Diſeaſes and Infirmities, as well as we know the Body and the Organs to be; and of what ſort ſoever we ſhall imagine this Spirit of Life to be, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Experience may aſſure, us that it oftentimes finds help and remedies againſt the Diſorders and Diſeaſes thereof, by good Air, wholſome and regular Diet, good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Muſick or Harmony, freedom from Cares, and other Eaſements and Satisfactions to the Minds of Men, as well as by Medicines and Helps adminiſtred by the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in divers Caſes. And thus have we run through and conſidered divers weighty particulars concerning the Bodily Organs, and the Minds of Men, with intent to apply the ſame to the two ſorts of Souls or Spirits which are now in diſpute between us; and have ſhewed that the Perfections of Humane Powers, both Senſitive and Rational, do more depend upon the Aptitude and Capacity of the Bodily Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, than upon that Spirit which gives Life and Motion to them: and next, that the Humane Mind or Spirit of Life in Man, is capable of Melioration and Detriment, by many
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107192:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuch Accidental Things as I have before enumerated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd; and from all theſe Premiſſes, I am very apt to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that if the Spirit of Life in Man, were an Intelligent Seperable and Extraneous Being; things could not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fall out in the Nature of Man, as they have before been declared commonly to do; but if this Spirit, which gives Life to Man, be taken for a Fire, yet Material and Unintelligent Spirit; all that hath before been ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Bodily Organs, and the Spirit or Mind of Man, will fall out to be very agrecable and homogenious to the Nature of ſuch a Spirit, and to the whole compoſition of the Humane Perſon. And hence I take upon me to infer, that the Spirit of Life in Man, is more likely to be Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Unintelligent, than to be ſuch a ſort of Intelligent and Self-ſubſiſting Spirit as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Party maintain the ſame to be.</p>
                  <p>A Third Objection againſt Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Opinion, I take a Simily, and raiſed from Mens Experience, and the common Conſideration of the Brutal Nature. Our daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence aſſures us, that by whatſoever Spirits the Brutes are acted, they fully enjoy the Powers of Life and Senſe, and ſome ſuch meaſures of Intellect, as gives them a Sagacity ſit to attain and accompliſh the ends of their Beings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' in the Degrees thereof they fall very much below ſuch Perfections of them, as are found in Men: by Vertue and Power of the Vital Spirits in Brutes, working in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Organs of their Bodies, their Animal Nature at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to as great a Perfection as the Humane Nature doth, as far as concerns the Vegitation and Senſation of them both. For the Brutes live as well, and as naturally, and as much as the Men do. And next, their Motions are as ſtrong, vigorous and active, as thoſe of the Men are, in both the ſorts of Motions which are common to them. Firſt, their I ward Motions of Heart, Lungs, Bowels, and other their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107192:99"/>Principal and Vital Entrals, which Sort of Motion we may term Involuntary, becauſe the Men or Beaſts can give no ſtoppage to them, but waking or ſleeping, in ſickneſs and in health, ſuch Motions are natural, and needful for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Life in the Creature, in whoſe power it is not to ſtop or alter them. And this ſort of Motion is needful for, and as active amongſt Beaſts as Men. The other ſort of Motion is that which Men call Local or Voluntary, ſuch as that of the Hands, Feet, Head, and other Members of the Body, which the Creature can uſe, or not uſe, at its own liking and pleaſure; and we find that the Motions of Brutes in this kind, are as vigorous, nimble and ſtrong, as thoſe of the Men are. Then if we proceed to the power and practice of their outward Senſes, as of Seeing, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Feeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Experience will convince us, that divers Brutes attain to as great Perfection in the uſe of ſuch Senſes, as the Generations of Men do, and ſome Brutes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Humane Powers, in the Practice and Uſe of ſome of theſe Senſes. And if we then conſider the Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Luſt, Wrath, and Fear, we may find that the Brutal Nature is as full of theſe Affections, as the Humane; and that the Beaſts have them in as great vigor, violence and perfection, as Men have them. And laſtly, if we riſe to conſider the Power of Intellect, we may find that Brutes injoy the true and real uſe of Phantaſie, Choice and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ſo far as is Needful for the well being of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, tho' in a weak meaſure, and very low degree, if we compare ſuch Faculties of theirs with ſuch as may be found in that kind amongſt the higheſt ranks of Men, or ſuch of them as have attain'd to great degrees of Improvement in their Faculties of that kind. It may be, that if we ſhall compare the moſt Stupid amongſt Men, with the moſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive amongſt Brutes, as with the Elephant, Ape, Horſe, Dog, and Fox; it may be found that ſome of theſe Creatures are more docible, and may be made more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107192:100"/>than ſome of the moſt ſtupid amongſt Men: ſo that by their Teachers Eye, or Continuance, or their Voices, they have been made to act and perform divers things which caus'd Admiration in the Beholders, and ſuch as it would be hard to teach the ſtupideſt Perſons amongſt Men to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in ſuch manner, as Beaſts have been known to do them. There appears between the Brutal and Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Compoſition, very great differences, and that the Men have many advantages above the Beaſts, in thoſe Parts and Members which appear outwardly to the Eye. Firſt, in the Members of their Hands and Tongue, and the genuine and natural uſes of them both: and next, in the natural and upright poſture of the Humane Body, and the placing of the Head thereupon, all which give great advantages to the Humane, above the Brutal Bodies, and gives them ſuch capacities of acting, as are deny'd to all Brutes whatſoever; and it ſeems we may reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that there may be the like great advantages, in the inward Organs of Humane, above thoſe of the Brutal Heads, and whereby the Humane are made more capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the great Duties of their Intellect, then the Brutal Creatures have Capacities to do; and yet we find theſe Differences do not hinder the perſons of Men from being ranked amongſt the Animal Kind; the prime Ingredients into whoſe Compoſition, are the ſame Fleſh, Blood, Bones, Breath, Nerves, Arteries, Veins, Joynts, Sinews and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which go to the Compoſition of them both. And Experience may convince us, that the Lives of them all are in their Blood, or that Blood is the life of them, and by the particles of ſuch Blood inflamed, called the Spirits of their Blood, they are all inlivened and acted alike; altho' by the Structure of their Bodies, and the Perfection of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to ſome purpoſes, the Humane Nature have very great advantages above the Brutal: and theſe are the main Differences which I have yet been able to find between
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107192:100"/>the two Natures before-mentioned; and I am hence ſo far convinced, as to conceive that there is no ſuch great and apparent Differences between that ſort of the Spirit of Life which acts the Brutes, and that ſort of Spirit which acts the Men, as heretofore hath generally been believed; but the Spirits which act Life in them both, are of a more ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar Nature than Men have formerly imagined them to be; and from this Argument I am ready to conclude, that the Humane Spirit of Life hath a great agreement with that of the Brutal, and therefore I think it more probable to be a Material Unintelligent Spirit, than that it ſhould be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent created extraneous Spirit, made by God for each Man at the time of his Procreation, and injected into the Embrion, at ſome incertain or unknown time, which yet remains unperceived or undeclared to us; and which if it ſhall be made better known, may deſerve to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examined amongſt us. Upon theſe three laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the Animal Nature and Humane Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, my firſt doubtings concerning the Seperate Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of souls were founded; after I had held out in the old Opinion until my Age of Sixty Three-Years, and my doubting caus'd me to ſearch the Scriptures concerning that Point, and there I found no Concurrence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Texts which were brought as Evidences thereof, and not ſo much as one Text that was clear in the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Doctor ſays, by Diſcourſe of Reaſon, we ſoon come certainly to know, that the Magnitude of the Sun is at leaſt 160 times greater than that of the Earth; and here I pretend to doubt the Certainty of the Doctor's knowledge concerning this Point: from this Page to Page 100, the Doctor argues, Whether the Intellect can work without the aſſiſtance of the Phanſie? a Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the beginning of his Book, <hi>de Anima;</hi> but both there and here, that Queſtion is left undetermined.</p>
            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:107192:103"/>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 102. The Doctor ſays, the Intellect doth frequently reflect upon it ſelf, and underſtand its own Intelligence. This I do not permit to paſs for a Truth; if we take the Intellect for a diſtinct thing from the Man conceiving that the Intellect as well as the Phantaſie, are Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Man, and that neither of them can do any thing of themſelves, but that all which either, or both of them do, are Acts of the Perſon in whom they reſide, and that they are both of them ſubmitted to the Guidance and Government of the Perſon, and the <hi>Totum</hi> of that Power of which they are but a part; ſo as to ſpeak properly and truly, we muſt ſay that the Man can conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately reflect upon the Acts and Powers of his Intellect, Phantaſie, Judgment and Memory, which is a thing which I ſhall eaſily grant; but that which I think lies upon the Doctor, and his Party to prove, is, the bare Intellect ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Perſon, can reflect upon it ſelf, or do any other Action whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 108. The Doctor ſays, That whatſoever can frame abſtracted Notions and form Univerſals, muſt be above Matter, and be Immaterial, but the Soul and Mind of Man can act in this ſort, <hi>Ergo,</hi> this Soul muſt be Immaterial. In this Argument I deny his Major, and ſay, that the Man himſelf who is a Material Agent, can form Abſtractive Notions, and from Singulars and Generals, can extract and frame Univerſals, and that the Intellect without the Man, can perform no ſuch Matters, nor be, nor act in any kind whatſoever,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 112. Here he quotes a Book, written by <hi>Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Rorarius,</hi> a Learned Prelate, as a Collection of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments commonly urged, to prove that many Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107192:104"/>have the uſe of Reaſon, as well as Man himſelf hath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 116. Here it is affirmed, That Men do not know the Intimate Nature of ſo much as the ſmalleſt Plant which grows upon the Ground; and therefore I ſay, we are like to fall much ſhort of the true Nature of the Humane Soul, with ſuch Certainty as were to be deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 118. The Doctor ſays, the Intellect is converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Spiritual Beings, both of good and other Spirits, and therefore is Immaterial. I anſwer as before, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect can do nothing, but as it is a Power and Faculty of the Perſon, without which I do not agree that it hath either Being or Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 123. The Doctor here ſays, that the old Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers obtained a certain Knowledge, that there were Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by the Regular Motions of the Heavenly Bodies, which they thought could not be maintained, without the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Government of Intelligent Immaterial Spirits; but I think they were as much deceived in their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as our Doctor ſeems to be in his Opinion of the Souls Immateriality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 123. It is objected againſt the Doctor, that when the Phanſie is diſturb'd, the Intellect cannot act with Strength or Freedom, and the Doctor confeſſes it to be true, and that the Soul as Immaterial as he ſuppoſes her, cannot act without Material Aſſiſtance of the Phanſie, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and other Senſitive Powers [and apparent it is, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Man nor the Soul can act any thing without the Spirits of the Blood.]</p>
            <pb n="205" facs="tcp:107192:104"/>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 126. The Doctor ſets down three Moral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proving the Souls Immateriality and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 1. The Univerſal conſent of Men to this Opinion. 2. Man's Innate and Inſeperable Appetite of Immortality. 3. The Juſtice of God, in rewarding good Men, and puniſhing the Evil after Death. Upon the firſt Argument he quotes <hi>Cicero</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Omni in re Conſenſio, omnium gentium, lex naturae putanda eſt;</hi> to this Rule I anſwer, that if it ſhould be admitted for a Rule, yet there are many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to be made out of it; and therefore I cannot admit it to have a binding force in this Caſe: and to the Doctor's Aſſertion of Univerſal Aſſent to the Souls Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, by which he would prove it a Conception Natural to the Mind of Man; I anſwer, that a Conception ſo proving, muſt be as Univerſal in Time, as in Places or Perſons; but we do not Read, or find that the Opinion of the Souls Immortality had a Being in the World, or was known amongſt Men before the Writings of <hi>Solomon;</hi> becauſe that in the Thouſands of Years before his time, we meet with no mention of that Opinion, neither amongſt the Patriarchs, nor the Moſaical Writings, nor any of the Prophets before <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time; nor do <hi>Job</hi> or <hi>David</hi> make any mention thereof. We Read, God laid great Puniſhments upon <hi>Cain</hi> for his Murther, which was of great Importance in that time of the World, and a very atroceous Fratricide; and yet we do not Read of ſo much as a Threat againſt the Soul of <hi>Cain,</hi> or any thing there ſpoken concerning Puniſhments future to this Life; but all the Puniſhments denounced to him for that Fact, were only Temporal, and of this World; nor do I find any Puniſhments future to this Life denounced againſt Sinners, until the Books of <hi>Solomon</hi> became extant in the World, ſave what was taken from the invention of ſome Poets; which might be received in the World ſomewhat
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107192:105"/>before his time. And hence I infer, That the Notion of the Souls Immortality is not Natural, becauſe for ſome Thouſands of Years from the Worlds beginning, that Notion was not received or known amongſt Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 131. The Doctor's Oppoſer ſays, the Opinion of the Souls Immortality is very Uſeful in Government, for that audacious Malefactors, who are not moved by the whole Arm of the Civil Magiſtrate, will yet tremble at the Finger of Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 133. It is poſſible (and Experience ſhews it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent) that an Opinion may be Univerſal, poſſeſſiing the Minds of all Men, for many Ages together, without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, which yet at length may be Diſcovered to be Falſe and Abſurd, as hath been Experienc'd in the Opinion of the Antipodes, and the Circumvolution of the Earth; both which till of late Years were held Unreaſonable and Phantaſtical; and perhaps this of the Souls Eternity may have the ſame Fate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 134. Our Doctor ſays, That to prove an Opinion derived from Nature, there is required an Aſſent of all Ages from the beginning of the World. To this I ſay, The Opinion of the Souls Immortality hath not ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that ſuch a Conſent neither hath been, or can be proved; and that therefore the Opinion it ſelf, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved derivable from Nature, or the Inſtinct thereof.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſays further, That from the Antiquity, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality and Perpetuity of any Opinion, we may ſafely conclude upon the Verity of it. Hereunto I anſwer, That the Opinion of the Suns Diurnal Motion about the Earth, had a greater Antiquity, and as great an Univerſality, and hath ſtill as ſtrong a Perpetuity, as that of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107192:105"/>either ever had, or yet hath, notwithſtanding all which the Learned World begins now to perceive, that it was always, and is ſtill an Error.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 138. Here the Doctor begins to produce and urge, his ſecond Moral Argument for the Souls Immortality; from the Deſires Men have of Perpetuity and Living af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Deaths, either in their own proper Beings, or in the Memories of ſuch as ſurvive their Departures. To this I anſwer, That if they deſire a Perpetuity of their own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Death, it ſeems they deſire that which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain, as all Men may, and do deſire a Perpetual Youth, Health, and Proſperity. Nature and Reaſon both aſſure us, that no Man doth or can deſire a perpetual, or a long Life, under great Pains and Sufferings, but a Life with Happineſs is very acceptable to all Men; and therefore they do not deſire Life alone, but as it is joyn'd with expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or hope of Happineſs; and hence I collect, that the much greater part of Mankind (which the ſinful World knownly are) do not deſire a future State of Life after Death, but rather that there were no Being for them after this Life, and would very much wiſh to be forgotten both by God and Men; and therefore a Perpetuity of Being is not deſired, or ſo much deſirable as our Doctor pretends it to be; whence I conceive the Doctor's Argument drawn from this Topick, hath but little Force or Coherſion in it, and not Strength enough to compel, or even to draw Men to a Coherence with the Doctor in his Opinion of the Souls Immortality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 145. Here the Doctor propounds his Third Moral Argument, for proving the Souls Immortality, and raiſes it from God's Divine Juſtice, and his Equitable Dealings with Men; and ſays, it is commonly obſerv'd, wicked Men proſper better in this World, than the Righteous uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107192:106"/>do, and conſequently that ſuch Men are not reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to their Works whilſt they live; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God's juſt dealing with Men cannot be defended, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing and believing a State of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after Death: and from hence ſaith the Doctor, it muſt unavoidably follow, that Rewards and Puniſhments will be diſtributed to Men after their departures out of this Life. To this I anſwer, That I agree to all that the Doctor hath here delivered: the Doctor replies, if you ſo do, you muſt likewiſe agree to the Doctrine of the Souls Immortality, or the Seperate Subſiſtence of it; for the Body after Death is not capable of receiving Reward or Puniſhment: it muſt therefore be the Soul alone, unto which ſuch Rewards and Puniſhments can be applied: Our Doctor not once mentioning, or appearing at all to think upon the laſt Articles of our Creed; <hi>I believe the Reſurrection of the Dead, and the Life Everlaſting,</hi> which ſeems to my Underſtanding a ſort of Proof, that he and the greateſt part of thoſe who believe and maintain the Souls Immortality, are very little mindful of our quoted Article, <hi>The Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> inſomuch as the Conceit of this Immortality ſeems to have eaten up and devoured the Article before-named, with the Uſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, and even to have exterminated the ſame out of the Apprehenſions and Memories of ſuch Men. And hereupon I do again agree, that it is very ſutable to the Juſtice of God, and his equitable Dealings with Men, that there ſhould be a diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after this Life; and I do with great Aſſurance believe that the ſame will fall out accordingly; not beſtowing thoſe Rewards and Puniſhments upon Souls Subſiſting in a State of Seperation from the Body, but that rather, as our Lord himſelf tells us, <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>Thoſe who fear God, and work Righteouſneſs, ſhall by Chriſt be raiſed up at the laſt Day in their full</hi> Compoſitum <hi>of Soul and Body, and in their own
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107192:106"/>Perſons ſhall receive Rewards according to their Works done, and their Faith profeſſed in this World; and that the like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhalt be dealt to the Wicked at the Reſurrection of the laſt Day, whoſe Puniſhments ſhall be equally diſtributed to their Perſons, as is before ſaid to be done in the caſe of the former Raiſed and Righteous Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 156. The Doctor ſays, He cannot but wonder that <hi>Plato,</hi> having aſſerted God to be a Mind Divine and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, ſhould contradict himſelf, in affirming that Man's Soul was a Particle, taken from the Subſtance of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he will not engulph himſelf in the Bottomleſs Sea of Difficulties, concerning the Original and Extraduction of Man's Soul; but he conceives the Soul cannot be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from Matter, becauſe it is Immaterial; but however, it is plain that it hath its Beginning and Origine with the Body; and yet being Incorporeal, it is not capable of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 159. He confeſſes a great decay of Intellect in Mens very old Age; but ſays, that Decay grows from the weakneſs of the Fancy and Imagination and the Organs thereof, and not from the Decays of the Intellect or Soul it ſelf. Anſwering, I ſay, it ſeems rather to grow from the Heavineſs and Unaptneſs of the Blood of old People, to be ſo vigorouſly Inflamed and Acted, as it uſed to be in their younger Years, and greater ſtrength of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Concoction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 173. The Doctor ſays, It is not neceſſary that when at Death the Soul is breathed into the Air, that the Air ſhould be thereby Animated, becauſe then it ſhould act without the Mediation of any Organs at all; but he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that neither in the Air, nor any other Body whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107192:107"/>can the Soul either meet with, or create thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that are requiſite to Vital Information.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 174. He ſays, The Soul makes uſe of the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as Servants for the effecting of Life, Senſe and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſay, Nature makes uſe of them for the effecting Life, Senſe, Motion, Underſtanding, Memory, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Powers of Cogitation whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 180. The Doctor ſays, As to the Particular or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Souls Knowledge after Death, I remit you to Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi>'s ſublime Speculations concerning the condition of a Seperate Soul, in which tho' you may not meet with ſuch Satisfaction as you expect, yet you will meet with more than I can now give you, without repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Notions. To this I anſwer, that I have peruſed thoſe Notions, without meeting with any Satisfaction at all in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 183. The Doctor ſays, That the Cement which joyns the Body and Soul together, is the Blood, eſpecially the Spiritual and moſt refin'd part thereof; and he quotes a Saying of <hi>Critius, Sentire, Maxime Proprinus eſſe Anima; atque hoc in eſſe propter ſanguinis Naturam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 184. He ſays, The Blood is the firſt pact of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that is generated and moved, and the Soul is excited and kindled firſt from the Blood; and the Blood is that in which the Operations Vegitative and Senſitive do firſt manifeſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſays, That he thinks it likely, that the Soul having its firſt, and perhaps principal Reſidence in the Blood, and that Blood by Circulation, flowing (like a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of living Water) round the Body, penetrating into,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107192:107"/>and irrigating the Subſtance of all the Parts, and at the ſame time communicating to them both Heat and Life, ſo as the Soul having its principal Reſidence in the Blood, in reſpect thereof, may very well be conceived to be, <hi>Tota in toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte;</hi> ſo as there is an Intimate preſence of the Soul in the Blood, and by that means, a Conjunction of them together.</p>
            <p>169. The Dr. ſays, That in the Progreſſion towards Death, the Vital Heat or Flame being either almoſt ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Putrefaction of the Blood (the only Fewel by which it is maintained) in Diſeaſes, or exhauſted by old Age, goes out like a Lamp by degrees, ceaſing firſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven or irradiate the parts that are moſt remote from the Focus or Heart; and then failing in its conſerving Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more and more, till at length ſuffering an Extinction in the very Heart (as it were in the Socket) it leaves that alſo Cold and Lifeleſs, ſo that Death is as an Extinction only of the Vital Flame, not of the Soul. I ſay, That it is an Extinction of that Vital Flame which I conceive to be the Soul or Spirit, or the firſt Principal of Life and Motion in the Perſon.</p>
            <p>I think that by the Doctor's Words in this laſt Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſeems fully to agree with what I have often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the total Extinction of the Vital Flame in the Blood, is the Death of the Perſon, and the very thing which turns that which was the living Body into a dead Carcaſs; whence he ſays, That Death is an Extinction of the Vital Flame, and yet denies this to be an extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul; whence it ſeems to me, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to maintain the Subſiſtence of the Soul after the death of the Perſon, altho' the Nature and Reaſon which he pretends to follow, convinced him not ſo to do, or that he found any natural need of his ſo doing; but becauſe he
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107192:108"/>thought it might be prov'd by Scripture, and was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Divines, That the Soul of Man had a Seperate Subſiſtence after death of the Perſon, and therefore was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and that he ſtood ſo perſwaded from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Grounds, he teſtifies. <hi>Pag.</hi> 185. where he ſays, That the Soul is an Immortal Subſtance, and that its Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not only credible by Faith, or upon Authority Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, but alſo demonſtrable by Reaſon, or the Light of Nature. From theſe Words I collect, That his Belief of the Souls Immortality, was grounded firſt upon Faith and Divine Authority, as he thought; and being thus fully perſwaded of the Truth of that Opinion, he ſet himſelf on work to maintain it, by ſuch Deductions as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make from the Principles of Nature and Reaſon; his Performances wherein have before been examined, and ſhewn not be of ſo great weight as he perhaps conceived them to be. The Treatiſe now examined, was publiſh'd ſo long ago, that I doubt before this time his Flame of Life hath been extinguiſh'd, or that he may not be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of replying to this Examination; and therefore I ſhall not need to expreſs what Amendments or Additions I think needful to be made to his Treatiſe, but I will rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf generally to ſay, That if any Man will pretend to prove the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence from Grounds of Nature and Reaſon, and to convince ſuch as doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I think it needful for him to apply to thoſe particulars which have before been put in Queſtion concerning the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi>

Thoſe that maintain the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, are at difference amongſt themſelves concerning divers of theſe particulars. In the firſt of theſe they all agree, that there is an Intelligent Self-ſubſiſting Spirit in the Body, which acts the Perſon and all his Powers; but in the 2. or
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107192:108"/>the <hi>Quid ſit,</hi> they differ, ſome holding it to be Material, and others thinking it to be Immaterial. 3. Concerning the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde Oritur,</hi> or from whence it derives its Original, there are three different Opinions. Firſt, That ſuch Souls praeexiſts <hi>a mundo condito,</hi> from the Creation of the World. Others ſay, That upon every Procreation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, God creates a new Soul for every newly procreated Body; as partly obliged thereunto, by the Congruity of his Being, requiring ſuch things to be done for Support of Mankind and the World. Others hold, That the Soul is generated by the Parents, together with the Body, or that the whole Humane Perſon is generated, as much and as perfectly, as one Horſe generates another. 4. For the <hi>Quando Ingreditur,</hi> or at what preciſe time the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly created Soul firſt enters into the Body; the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this Opinion are not yet agreed, whether it enter at the firſt Commixture of the Seed, or at the Coagulation of it; or whether during its Firmentation, or during the time of the Fomentation thereof, or at the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of its Vegitation, or at the firſt Formation of Parts in the Embrion; and ſome have thought that this ſort of Soul doth not enter till the irruption or breaking forth of the Infant into the World. 5. Concerning the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> or the place where this ſort of Soul reſides, during its continuance in the Body, the maintainers of it differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> thought it a lucky Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own, when he found its Reſidence to be in the <hi>Glandula Penialis,</hi> placed in a Paſſage between two parts of the Brain. Others think the whole Brain to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Reſidence thereof. Some ſay it reſides in the Heart, or near about it, and that thereby the Heart becomes <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Vivens &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimum Moriens.</hi> Others with our Doctor (in his Page before quoted) think this Souls Reſidence to be in the Blood, and commixed with the circulating Parts thereof. 6. Concerning the Mode or Manner of this
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107192:109"/>Souls Operation, all the maintainers thereof confeſs their Ignorance, and agree that they know not the manner of its Operation upon, or in the Body. 7. About the <hi>Quo avolat,</hi> or what becomes of this Soul, at its departure from the Body; the maintainers of it are not agreed among themſelves; ſome of them ſay it returns to God who gave it, but whether as a Part to its whole, or as a Party going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge for his Tryal, is not known. Others ſay, That ſuch Souls are carryed by Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, or by Devils into Hell, or by Papal Officers into Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or into the <hi>Limbo's Patrum, vel Puerorum.</hi> Some think that upon their departure from the Perſon, good Souls are rapt up into Paradiſe, as they think the Thief's Soul was when it departed from the Croſs. Others have pretended, that within, and under the ſurface of our Earth, there are pleaſant places which they termed the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſian Fields, or Happy Shades for Souls that were good, to live and converſe in; and places alſo within, or under our Earth, for Puniſhment or Torment of the wicked. Some have invented, as places of Happineſs for good Souls, the Iſland of <hi>Taprobana,</hi> and other Iſlands, which they termed Fortunate; and where they believed good Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted forth of this Life, obtained a ſtate of Happineſs for the future. It ſeems our later Divines have not thought any of theſe Places a ſufficient Reward for the Merits of their Proſylites, or the deſire they have to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to places of great Happineſs; and therefore they tell them, that immediately after Death, their Souls ſhall be tranſported into Heaven, and there enjoy the Happineſs of Angelical Manſions, and the raviſhing Viſions of God and Chriſt, a Converſation with Angels and the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect; and whatſoever they find any where mention'd in Scripture, to be beſtow'd by God upon the Bleſſed, at the time of the Reſurrection, and the laſt Judgment, they apply to the ſtate of good Men's Souls, immediately after the time of their Deaths.</p>

            <p>I do heartily deſire that they both could and would give ſuch an Account to the World, concerning the Reaſons and Grounds of their ſo doing, as may give Satisfaction to ſuch Doubting and Conſidering Perſons, who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to receive a ſatisfactory Account thereof, that they might more heartily joyn with ſuch predicated Opinions, than at the preſent they find themſelves able to do. I find it not common to meet with Writers, or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who pretend to prove the Souls Seperate Subſiſtence, from Grounds of Nature and Reaſon, which it ſeems was our preſent Author's Intention to prove; but I think he hath fail'd in his propounded Succeſs of that Intention, and that it may juſtly be ſaid of him, <hi>Magnis ecedit auſis;</hi> but I ſhould be very glad to ſee he had another able Perſon to ſucceed him in that Endeavour, being my ſelf very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to receive Inſtruction concerning this Point. And in Expectation thereof, I reſolve to confine my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon our Doctor's preſent Treatiſe, to what hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ſpoken concerning it, without making any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Addition thereunto, ſave my hearty Wiſhes for a clear and true Determination of this Queſtion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal I give my Intelligent Reader the Farewel.</p>
